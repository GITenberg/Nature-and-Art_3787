<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Elizabeth Simpson was born on the 15th of October, 1753, one
of the eight children of a poor farmer, at Standingfield, near
Bury St. Edmunds.&nbsp; Five of the children were girls, who were
all gifted with personal beauty.&nbsp; The family was Roman
Catholic.&nbsp; The mother had a delight in visits to the Bury
Theatre, and took, when she could, her children to the
play.&nbsp; One of her sons became an actor, and her daughter
Elizabeth offered herself at eighteen&mdash;her father then being
dead&mdash;for engagement as an actress at the Norwich
Theatre.&nbsp; She had an impediment of speech, and she was not
engaged; but in the following year, leaving behind an
affectionate letter to her mother, she stole away from
Standingfield, and made a bold plunge into the unknown world of
London, where she had friends, upon whose help she relied.&nbsp;
Her friends happened to be in Wales, and she had some troubles to
go through before she found a home in the house of a sister, who
had married a poor tailor.&nbsp; About two months after she had
left Standingfield she married, in London, Mr. Inchbald, an
actor, who had paid his addresses to her when she was at home,
and who was also a Roman Catholic.&nbsp; On the evening of the
wedding day the bride, who had not yet succeeded in obtaining an
engagement, went to the play, and saw the bridegroom play the
part of Mr. Oakley in the &ldquo;Jealous Wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Inchbald was thirty-seven years old, and had sons by a former
marriage.&nbsp; In September, 1772, Mrs. Inchbald tried her
fortune on the stage by playing Cordelia to her husband&rsquo;s
Lear.&nbsp; Beauty alone could not assure success.&nbsp; The
impediment in speech made it impossible for Mrs. Inchbald to
succeed greatly as an actress.&nbsp; She was unable to realise
her own conceptions.&nbsp; At times she and her husband prospered
so little that on one day their dinner was of turnips, pulled and
eaten in a field, and sometimes there was no dinner at all.&nbsp;
But better days presently followed; first acquaintance of Mrs.
Inchbald with Mrs. Siddons grew to a strong friendship, and this
extended to the other members of the Kemble family.</p>
<p>After seven years of happy but childless marriage, Mrs.
Inchbald was left a widow at the age of twenty-six.&nbsp; In
after years, when devoting herself to the baby of one of her
landladies, she wrote to a friend,&mdash;&ldquo;I shall never
again have patience with a mother who complains of anything but
the loss of her children; so no complaints when you see me
again.&nbsp; Remember, you have had two children, and I never had
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; After her husband&rsquo;s death, Mrs.
Inchbald&rsquo;s beauty surrounded her with admirers, some of
them rich, but she did not marry again.&nbsp; To one of those who
offered marriage, she replied that her temper was so uncertain
that nothing but blind affection in a husband could bear with
it.&nbsp; Yet she was patiently living and fighting the world on
a weekly salary of about thirty shillings, out of which she
helped her poorer sisters.&nbsp; When acting at Edinburgh she
spent on herself only eight shillings a week in board and
lodging.&nbsp; It was after her husband&rsquo;s death that Mrs.
Inchbald finished a little novel, called &ldquo;A Simple
Story,&rdquo; but it was not until twelve years afterwards that
she could get it published.&nbsp; She came to London again, and
wrote farces, which she could not get accepted; but she obtained
an increase of salary to three pounds a week by unwillingly
consenting not only to act in plays, but also to walk in
pantomime.&nbsp; At last, in July, 1784, her first farce,
&ldquo;The Mogul Tale,&rdquo; was acted.&nbsp; It brought her a
hundred guineas.&nbsp; Three years later her success as a writer
had risen so far that she obtained nine hundred pounds by a
little piece called &ldquo;Such Things Are.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
still lived sparingly, invested savings, and was liberal only to
the poor, and chiefly to her sisters and the poor members of her
family.&nbsp; She finished a sketch of her life in 1786, for
which a publisher, without seeing it, offered a thousand
pounds.&nbsp; But there was more satirical comment in it than she
liked, and she resolved to do at once what she would wish done at
the point of death.&nbsp; She destroyed the record.</p>
<p>In 1791 Mrs. Inchbald published her &ldquo;Simple
Story.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her other tale, &ldquo;Nature and Art,&rdquo;
followed in 1794, when Mrs. Inchbald&rsquo;s age was
forty-one.&nbsp; She had retired from the stage five years
before, with an income of fifty-eight pounds a year, all she
called her own out of the independence secured by her
savings.&nbsp; She lived in cheap lodgings, and had sometimes to
wait altogether on herself; at one lodging &ldquo;fetching up her
own water three pair of stairs, and dropping a few tears into the
heedless stream, as any other wounded deer might do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Later in life, she wrote to a friend from a room in which she
cooked, and ate, and also her saucepans were
cleaned:&mdash;&ldquo;Thank God, I can say No.&nbsp; I say No to
all the vanities of the world, and perhaps soon shall have to say
that I allow my poor infirm sister a hundred a year.&nbsp; I have
raised my allowance to eighty; but in the rapid stride of her
wants, and my obligation as a Christian to make no selfish
refusal to the poor, a few months, I foresee, must make the sum a
hundred.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1816, when that sister died, and Mrs.
Inchbald buried the last of her immediate home
relations&mdash;though she had still nephews to find money
for&mdash;she said it had been a consolation to her when
sometimes she cried with cold to think that her sister, who was
less able to bear privation, had her fire lighted for her before
she rose, and her food brought to her ready cooked.</p>
<p>Even at fifty Mrs. Inchbald&rsquo;s beauty of face inspired
admiration.&nbsp; The beauty of the inner life increased with
years.&nbsp; Lively and quick of temper, impulsive, sensitive,
she took into her heart all that was best in the sentiments
associated with the teaching of Rousseau and the dreams of the
French Revolution.&nbsp; Mrs. Inchbald spoke her mind most fully
in this little story, which is told with a dramatic sense of
construction that swiftly carries on the action to its
close.&nbsp; She was no weak sentimentalist, who hung out her
feelings to view as an idle form of self-indulgence.&nbsp; Most
unselfishly she wrought her own life to the pattern in her mind;
even the little faults she could not conquer, she well knew.</p>
<p>Mrs. Inchbald died at the age of sixty-eight, on the 1st of
August, 1821, a devout Roman Catholic, her thoughts in her last
years looking habitually through all disguises of convention up
to Nature&rsquo;s God.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>At a time when the nobility of Britain were said, by the poet
laureate, to be the admirers and protectors of the arts, and were
acknowledged by the whole nation to be the patrons of
music&mdash;William and Henry, youths under twenty years of age,
brothers, and the sons of a country shopkeeper who had lately
died insolvent, set out on foot for London, in the hope of
procuring by their industry a scanty subsistence.</p>
<p>As they walked out of their native town, each with a small
bundle at his back, each observed the other drop several tears:
but, upon the sudden meeting of their eyes, they both smiled with
a degree of disdain at the weakness in which they had been
caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said William (the elder), &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what makes me cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I neither,&rdquo; said Henry; &ldquo;for though we
may never see this town again, yet we leave nothing behind us to
give us reason to lament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied William, &ldquo;nor anybody who
cares what becomes of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was thinking,&rdquo; said Henry, now weeping
bitterly, &ldquo;that, if my poor father were alive, <i>he</i>
would care what was to become of us: he would not have suffered
us to begin this long journey without a few more shillings in our
pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of this sentence, William, who had with some effort
suppressed his tears while his brother spoke, now uttered, with a
voice almost inarticulate,&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say any more;
don&rsquo;t talk any more about it.&nbsp; My father used to tell
us, that when he was gone we must take care of ourselves: and so
we must.&nbsp; I only wish,&rdquo; continued he, giving way to
his grief, &ldquo;that I had never done anything to offend him
while he was living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I wish too,&rdquo; cried Henry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I had always been dutiful to him while he was alive, I
would not shed one tear for him now that he is gone&mdash;but I
would thank Heaven that he has escaped from his
creditors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In conversation such as this, wherein their sorrow for their
deceased parent seemed less for his death than because he had not
been so happy when living as they ought to have made him; and
wherein their own outcast fortune was less the subject of their
grief, than the reflection what their father would have endured
could he have beheld them in their present situation;&mdash;in
conversation such as this, they pursued their journey till they
arrived at that metropolis, which has received for centuries
past, from the provincial towns, the bold adventurer of every
denomination; has stamped his character with experience and
example; and, while it has bestowed on some coronets and
mitres&mdash;on some the lasting fame of genius&mdash;to others
has dealt beggary, infamy, and untimely death.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>After three weeks passed in London, a year followed, during
which William and Henry never sat down to a dinner, or went into
a bed, without hearts glowing with thankfulness to that
Providence who had bestowed on them such unexpected blessings;
for they no longer presumed to expect (what still they hoped they
deserved) a secure pittance in this world of plenty.&nbsp; Their
experience, since they came to town, had informed them that to
obtain a permanent livelihood is the good fortune but of a part
of those who are in want of it: and the precarious earning of
half-a-crown, or a shilling, in the neighbourhood where they
lodged, by an errand, or some such accidental means, was the sole
support which they at present enjoyed.</p>
<p>They had sought for constant employment of various kinds, and
even for servants&rsquo; places; but obstacles had always
occurred to prevent their success.&nbsp; If they applied for the
situation of a clerk to a man of extensive concerns, their
qualifications were admitted; but there must be security given
for their fidelity;&mdash;they had friends, who would give them a
character, but who would give them nothing else.</p>
<p>If they applied for the place even of a menial servant, they
were too clownish and awkward for the presence of the lady of the
house;&mdash;and once, when William (who had been educated at the
free grammar-school of the town in which he was born, and was an
excellent scholar), hoping to obtain the good opinion of a young
clergyman whom he solicited for the favour of waiting upon him,
said submissively, &ldquo;that he understood Greek and
Latin,&rdquo; he was rejected by the divine, &ldquo;because he
could not dress hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weary of repeating their mean accomplishments of
&ldquo;honesty, sobriety, humility,&rdquo; and on the precipice
of reprobating such qualities,&mdash;which, however beneficial to
the soul, gave no hope of preservation to the body,&mdash;they
were prevented from this profanation by the fortunate remembrance
of one qualification, which Henry, the possessor, in all his
distress, had never till then called to his recollection; but
which, as soon as remembered and made known, changed the whole
prospect of wretchedness placed before the two brothers; and they
never knew want more.</p>
<p>Reader&mdash;Henry could play upon the fiddle.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>No sooner was it publicly known that Henry could play most
enchantingly upon the violin, than he was invited into many
companies where no other accomplishment could have introduced
him.&nbsp; His performance was so much admired, that he had the
honour of being admitted to several tavern feasts, of which he
had also the honour to partake without partaking of the
expense.&nbsp; He was soon addressed by persons of the very first
rank and fashion, and was once seen walking side by side with a
peer.</p>
<p>But yet, in the midst of this powerful occasion for rejoicing,
Henry, whose heart was particularly affectionate, had one grief
which eclipsed all the happiness of his new life;&mdash;his
brother William could <i>not</i> play on the fiddle!
consequently, his brother William, with whom he had shared so
much ill, could not share in his good fortune.</p>
<p>One evening, Henry, coming home from a dinner and concert at
the Crown and Anchor found William, in a very gloomy and peevish
humour, poring over the orations of Cicero.&nbsp; Henry asked him
several times &ldquo;how he did,&rdquo; and similar questions,
marks of his kind disposition towards his beloved brother: but
all his endeavours, he perceived, could not soothe or soften the
sullen mind of William.&nbsp; At length, taking from his pocket a
handful of almonds, and some delicious fruit (which he had
purloined from the plenteous table, where his brother&rsquo;s
wants had never been absent from his thoughts), and laying them
down before him, he exclaimed, with a benevolent smile,
&ldquo;Do, William, let me teach you to play upon the
violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William, full of the great orator whom he was then studying,
and still more alive to the impossibility that <i>his</i> ear,
attuned only to sense, could ever descend from that elevation, to
learn mere sounds&mdash;William caught up the tempting presents
which Henry had ventured his reputation to obtain for him, and
threw them all indignantly at the donor&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Henry felt too powerfully his own superiority of fortune to
resent this ingratitude: he patiently picked up the repast, and
laying it again upon the table, placed by its side a bottle of
claret, which he held fast by the neck, while he assured his
brother that, &ldquo;although he had taken it while the
waiter&rsquo;s back was turned, yet it might be drank with a safe
conscience by them; for he had not himself tasted one drop at the
feast, on purpose that he might enjoy a glass with his brother at
home, and without wronging the company who had invited
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The affection Henry expressed as he said this, or the force of
a bumper of wine, which William had not seen since he left his
father&rsquo;s house, had such an effect in calming the
displeasure he was cherishing, that, on his brother offering him
the glass, he took it; and he deigned even to eat of his
present.</p>
<p>Henry, to convince him that he had stinted himself to obtain
for him this collation, sat down and partook of it.</p>
<p>After a few glasses, he again ventured to say, &ldquo;Do,
brother William, let me teach you to play on the
violin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again his offer was refused, though with less vehemence: at
length they both agreed that the attempt could not prosper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;William, go down to
Oxford or to Cambridge.&nbsp; There, no doubt, they are as fond
of learning as in this gay town they are of music.&nbsp; You know
you have as much talent for the one as I for the other: do go to
one of our universities, and see what dinners, what suppers, and
what friends you will find there.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>William <i>did</i> go to one of those seats of learning, and
would have starved there, but for the affectionate remittances of
Henry, who shortly became so great a proficient in the art of
music, as to have it in his power not only to live in a very
reputable manner himself, but to send such supplies to his
brother, as enabled him to pursue his studies.</p>
<p>With some, the progress of fortune is rapid.&nbsp; Such is the
case when, either on merit or demerit, great patronage is
bestowed.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;s violin had often charmed, to a
welcome forgetfulness of his insignificance, an effeminate lord;
or warmed with ideas of honour the head of a duke, whose heart
could never be taught to feel its manly glow.&nbsp; Princes had
flown to the arms of their favourite fair ones with more
rapturous delight, softened by the masterly touches of his art:
and these elevated personages, ever grateful to those from whom
they receive benefits, were competitors in the desire of heaping
favours upon him.&nbsp; But he, in all his advantages, never once
lost for a moment the hope of some advantage for his brother
William: and when at any time he was pressed by a patron to
demand a &ldquo;token of his regard,&rdquo; he would constantly
reply&mdash;&ldquo;I have a brother, a very learned man, if your
lordship (your grace, or your royal highness) would confer some
small favour on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His lordship would reply, &ldquo;He was so teased and harassed
in his youth by learned men, that he had ever since detested the
whole fraternity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His grace would inquire, &ldquo;if the learned man could play
upon any instrument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And his highness would ask &ldquo;if he could sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebuffs such as these poor Henry met with in all his
applications for William, till one fortunate evening, at the
conclusion of a concert, a great man shook him by the hand, and
promised a living of five hundred a year (the incumbent of which
was upon his death-bed) to his brother, in return for the
entertainment that Henry had just afforded him.</p>
<p>Henry wrote in haste to William, and began his letter thus:
&ldquo;My dear brother, I am not sorry you did not learn to play
upon the fiddle.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>The incumbent of this living died&mdash;William underwent the
customary examinations, obtained successively the orders of
deacon and priest; then as early as possible came to town to take
possession of the gift which his brother&rsquo;s skill had
acquired for him.</p>
<p>William had a steady countenance, a stern brow, and a majestic
walk; all of which this new accession, this holy calling to
religious vows, rather increased than diminished.&nbsp; In the
early part of his life, the violin of his brother had rather
irritated than soothed the morose disposition of his nature: and
though, since their departure from their native habitation, it
had frequently calmed the violent ragings of his huger, it had
never been successful in appeasing the disturbed passions of a
proud and disdainful mind.</p>
<p>As the painter views with delight and wonder the finished
picture, expressive testimony of his taste and genius; as the
physician beholds with pride and gladness the recovering invalid,
whom his art has snatched from the jaws of death; as the father
gazes with rapture on his first child, the creature to whom he
has given life; so did Henry survey, with transporting glory, his
brother, dressed for the first time in canonicals, to preach at
his parish church.&nbsp; He viewed him from head to
foot&mdash;smiled&mdash;viewed again&mdash;pulled one side of his
gown a little this way, one end of his band a little that way;
then stole behind him, pretending to place the curls of his hair,
but in reality to indulge and to conceal tears of fraternal pride
and joy.</p>
<p>William was not without joy, neither was he wanting in love or
gratitude to his brother; but his pride was not completely
satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the elder,&rdquo; thought he to himself,
&ldquo;and a man of literature, and yet am I obliged to my
younger brother, an illiterate man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he
suppressed every thought which could be a reproach to that
brother.&nbsp; But there remained an object of his former
contempt, now become even detestable to him; ungrateful
man.&nbsp; The very agent of his elevation was now so odious to
him, that he could not cast his eyes upon the friendly violin
without instant emotions of disgust.</p>
<p>In vain would Henry, at times, endeavour to subdue his
haughtiness by a tune on this wonderful machine.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know I have no ear,&rdquo; William would sternly say, in
recompense for one of Henry&rsquo;s best solos.&nbsp; Yet was
William enraged at Henry&rsquo;s answer, when, after taking him
to hear him preach, he asked him, &ldquo;how he liked his
sermon,&rdquo; and Henry modestly replied (in the technical
phrase of his profession), &ldquo;You know, brother, I have no
ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s renown in his profession daily increased; and,
with his fame, his friends.&nbsp; Possessing the virtues of
humility and charity far above William, who was the professed
teacher of those virtues, his reverend brother&rsquo;s disrespect
for his vocation never once made him relax for a moment in his
anxiety to gain him advancement in the Church.&nbsp; In the
course of a few years, and in consequence of many fortuitous
circumstances, he had the gratification of procuring for him the
appointment to a deanery; and thus at once placed between them an
insurmountable barrier to all friendship, that was not the effect
of condescension on the part of the dean.</p>
<p>William would now begin seriously to remonstrate with his
brother &ldquo;upon his useless occupation,&rdquo; and would
intimate &ldquo;the degradation it was to him to hear his
frivolous talent spoken of in all companies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry
believed his brother to be much wiser than himself, and suffered
shame that he was not more worthy of such a relation.&nbsp; To
console himself for the familiar friend, whom he now perceived he
had entirely lost, he searched for one of a softer
nature&mdash;he married.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>As Henry despaired of receiving his brother&rsquo;s
approbation of his choice, he never mentioned the event to
him.&nbsp; But William, being told of it by a third person,
inquired of Henry, who confirmed the truth of the intelligence,
and acknowledged, that, in taking a wife, his sole view had been
to obtain a kind companion and friend, who would bear with his
failings and know how to esteem his few qualifications;
therefore, he had chosen one of his own rank in life, and who,
having a taste for music, and, as well as himself, an obligation
to the art&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is it possible,&rdquo; cried the dean, &ldquo;that
what has been hinted to me is true?&nbsp; Is it possible that you
have married a public singer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is as good as myself,&rdquo; returned Henry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I did not wish her to be better, for fear she should
despise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to despise,&rdquo; answered the dean, &ldquo;Heaven
forbid that we should despise anyone, that would be acting unlike
a Christian; but do you imagine I can ever introduce her to my
intended wife, who is a woman of family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry had received in his life many insults from his brother;
but, as he was not a vain man, he generally thought his brother
in the right, and consequently submitted with patience; but,
though he had little self-love, he had for his wife an unbounded
affection.&nbsp; On the present occasion, therefore, he began to
raise his voice, and even (in the coarse expression of clownish
anger) to lift his hand; but the sudden and affecting
recollection of what he had done for the dean&mdash;of the pains,
the toils, the hopes, and the fears he had experienced when
soliciting his preferment&mdash;this recollection overpowered his
speech, weakened his arm, and deprived him of every active force,
but that of flying out of his brother&rsquo;s house (in which
they then were) as swift as lightning, while the dean sat proudly
contemplating &ldquo;that he had done his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For several days Henry did not call, as was his custom, to see
his brother.&nbsp; William&rsquo;s marriage drew near, and he
sent a formal card to invite him on that day; but not having had
the condescension to name his sister-in-law in the invitation,
Henry thought proper not to accept it, and the joyful event was
celebrated without his presence.&nbsp; But the ardour of the
bridegroom was not so vehement as to overcome every other
sensation&mdash;he missed his brother.&nbsp; That heartfelt
cheerfulness with which Henry had ever given him joy upon every
happy occasion&mdash;even amidst all the politer congratulations
of his other friends&mdash;seemed to the dean mournfully
wanting.&nbsp; This derogation from his felicity he was resolved
to resent; and for a whole year these brothers, whom adversity
had entwined closely together, prosperity separated.</p>
<p>Though Henry, on his marriage, paid so much attention to his
brother&rsquo;s prejudices as to take his wife from her public
employment, this had not so entirely removed the scruples of
William as to permit him to think her a worthy companion for Lady
Clementina, the daughter of a poor Scotch earl, whom he had
chosen merely that he might be proud of her family, and, in
return, suffer that family to be ashamed of <i>his</i>.</p>
<p>If Henry&rsquo;s wife were not fit company for Lady
Clementina, it is to be hoped that she was company for
angels.&nbsp; She died within the first year of her marriage, a
faithful, an affectionate wife, and a mother.</p>
<p>When William heard of her death, he felt a sudden shock, and a
kind of fleeting thought glanced across his mind, that</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he known she had been so near her dissolution, she
might have been introduced to Lady Clementina, and he himself
would have called her sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is (if he had defined his fleeting idea), &ldquo;They
would have had no objection to have met this poor woman for the
<i>last time</i>, and would have descended to the familiarity of
kindred, in order to have wished her a good journey to the other
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, is there in death something which so raises the abjectness
of the poor, that, on their approach to its sheltering abode, the
arrogant believer feels the equality he had before denied, and
trembles?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>The wife of Henry had been dead near six weeks before the dean
heard the news.&nbsp; A month then elapsed in thoughts by
himself, and consultations with Lady Clementina, how he should
conduct himself on this occurrence.&nbsp; Her advice was,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, as Henry was the younger, and by their stations,
in every sense the dean&rsquo;s inferior, Henry ought first to
make overtures of reconciliation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean answered, &ldquo;He had no doubt of his
brother&rsquo;s good will to him, but that he had reason to
think, from the knowledge of his temper, he would be more likely
to come to him upon an occasion to bestow comfort, than to
receive it.&nbsp; For instance, if I had suffered the misfortune
of losing your ladyship, my brother, I have no doubt, would have
forgotten his resentment, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was offended that the loss of the vulgar wife of Henry
should be compared to the loss of her&mdash;she lamented her
indiscretion in forming an alliance with a family of no rank, and
implored the dean to wait till his brother should make some
concession to him, before he renewed the acquaintance.</p>
<p>Though Lady Clementina had mentioned on this occasion her
<i>indiscretion</i>, she was of a prudent age&mdash;she was near
forty&mdash;yet, possessing rather a handsome face and person,
she would not have impressed the spectator with a supposition
that she was near so old had she not constantly attempted to
appear much younger.&nbsp; Her dress was fantastically
fashionable, her manners affected all the various passions of
youth, and her conversation was perpetually embellished with
accusations against her own &ldquo;heedlessness, thoughtlessness,
carelessness, and childishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is, perhaps in each individual, one parent motive to
every action, good or bad.&nbsp; Be that as it may, it was
evident, that with Lady Clementina, all she said or did, all she
thought or looked, had but one foundation&mdash;vanity.&nbsp; If
she were nice, or if she were negligent, vanity was the cause of
both; for she would contemplate with the highest degree of
self-complacency, &ldquo;What such-a-one would say of her elegant
preciseness, or what such-a-one would think of her interesting
neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If she complained she was ill, it was with the certainty that
her languor would be admired: if she boasted she was well, it was
that the spectator might admire her glowing health: if she
laughed, it was because she thought it made her look pretty: if
she cried, it was because she thought it made her look prettier
still.&nbsp; If she scolded her servants, it was from vanity, to
show her knowledge superior to theirs: and she was kind to them
from the same motive, that her benevolence might excite their
admiration.&nbsp; Forward and impertinent in the company of her
equals, from the vanity of supposing herself above them, she was
bashful even to shamefacedness in the presence of her superiors,
because her vanity told her she engrossed all their
observation.&nbsp; Through vanity she had no memory, for she
constantly forgot everything she heard others say, from the
minute attention which she paid to everything she said
herself.</p>
<p>She had become an old maid from vanity, believing no offer she
received worthy of her deserts; and when her power of farther
conquest began to be doubted, she married from vanity, to repair
the character of her fading charms.&nbsp; In a word, her vanity
was of that magnitude, that she had no conjecture but that she
was humble in her own opinion; and it would have been impossible
to have convinced her that she thought well of herself, because
she thought so <i>well</i>, as to be assured that her own
thoughts undervalued her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>That, which in a weak woman is called vanity, in a man of
sense is termed pride.&nbsp; Make one a degree stranger, or the
other a degree weaker, and the dean and his wife were infected
with the self-same folly.&nbsp; Yet, let not the reader suppose
that this failing (however despicable) had erased from either
bosom all traces of humanity.&nbsp; They are human creatures who
are meant to be portrayed in this little book: and where is the
human creature who has not some good qualities to soften, if not
to counterbalance, his bad ones?</p>
<p>The dean, with all his pride, could not wholly forget his
brother, nor eradicate from his remembrance the friend that he
had been to him: he resolved, therefore, in spite of his
wife&rsquo;s advice, to make him some overture, which he had no
doubt Henry&rsquo;s good-nature would instantly accept.&nbsp; The
more he became acquainted with all the vain and selfish
propensities of Lady Clementina, the more he felt a returning
affection for his brother: but little did he suspect how much he
loved him, till (after sending to various places to inquire for
him) he learned&mdash;that on his wife&rsquo;s decease, unable to
support her loss in the surrounding scene, Henry had taken the
child she brought him in his arms, shaken hands with all his
former friends&mdash;passing over his brother in the
number&mdash;and set sail in a vessel bound for Africa, with a
party of Portuguese and some few English adventurers, to people
there the uninhabited part of an extensive island.</p>
<p>This was a resolution, in Henry&rsquo;s circumstances, worthy
a mind of singular sensibility: but William had not discerned,
till then, that every act of Henry&rsquo;s was of the same
description; and more than all, his every act towards him.&nbsp;
He staggered when he heard the tidings; at first thought them
untrue; but quickly recollected, that Henry was capable of
surprising deeds!&nbsp; He recollected with a force which gave
him torture, the benevolence his brother had ever shown to
him&mdash;the favours he had heaped upon him&mdash;the insults he
had patiently endured in requital!</p>
<p>In the first emotion, which this intelligence gave the dean,
he forgot the dignity of his walk and gesture: he ran with
frantic enthusiasm to every corner of his deanery where the least
vestige of what belonged to Henry remained&mdash;he pressed close
to his breast, with tender agony, a coat of his, which by
accident had been left there&mdash;he kissed and wept over a
walking-stick which Henry once had given him&mdash;he even took
up with delight a music book of his brother&rsquo;s&mdash;nor
would his poor violin have then excited anger.</p>
<p>When his grief became more calm, he sat in deep and melancholy
meditation, calling to mind when and where he saw his brother
last.&nbsp; The recollection gave him fresh cause of
regret.&nbsp; He remembered they had parted on his refusing to
suffer Lady Clementina to admit the acquaintance of Henry&rsquo;s
wife.&nbsp; Both Henry and his wife he now contemplated beyond
the reach of his pride; and he felt the meanness of his former
and the imbecility of his future haughtiness towards them.</p>
<p>To add to his self-reproaches, his tormented memory presented
to him the exact countenance of his brother at their last
interview, as it changed, while he censured his marriage, and
treated with disrespect the object of his conjugal
affection.&nbsp; He remembered the anger repressed, the tear
bursting forth, and the last glimpse he had of him, as he left
his presence, most likely for ever.</p>
<p>In vain he now wished that he had followed him to the
door&mdash;that he had once shaken hands and owned his
obligations to him before they had parted.&nbsp; In vain he
wished too, that, in this extreme agony of his mind, he had such
a friend to comfort him, as Henry had ever proved.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>The avocations of an elevated life erase the deepest
impressions.&nbsp; The dean in a few months recovered from those
which his brother&rsquo;s departure first made upon him: and he
would now at times even condemn, in anger, Henry&rsquo;s having
so hastily abandoned him and his native country, in resentment,
as he conceived, of a few misfortunes which his usual fortitude
should have taught him to have borne.&nbsp; Yet was he still
desirous of his return, and wrote two or three letters expressive
of his wish, which he anxiously endeavoured should reach
him.&nbsp; But many years having elapsed without any intelligence
from him, and a report having arrived that he, and all the party
with whom he went, were slain by the savage inhabitants of the
island, William&rsquo;s despair of seeing his brother again
caused the desire to diminish; while attention and affection to a
still nearer and dearer relation than Henry had ever been to him,
now chiefly engaged his mind.</p>
<p>Lady Clementina had brought him a son, on whom from his
infancy, he doated&mdash;and the boy, in riper years, possessing
a handsome person and evincing a quickness of parts, gratified
the father&rsquo;s darling passion, pride, as well as the
mother&rsquo;s vanity.</p>
<p>The dean had, beside this child, a domestic comfort highly
gratifying to his ambition: the bishop of --- became intimately
acquainted with him soon after his marriage, and from his daily
visits had become, as it were, a part of the family.&nbsp; This
was much honour to the dean, not only as the bishop was his
superior in the Church, but was of that part of the bench whose
blood is ennobled by a race of ancestors, and to which all wisdom
on the plebeian side crouches in humble respect.</p>
<p>Year after year rolled on in pride and grandeur; the bishop
and the dean passing their time in attending lev&eacute;es and in
talking politics; Lady Clementina passing hers in attending routs
and in talking of <i>herself</i>, till the son arrived at the age
of thirteen.</p>
<p>Young William passed <i>his</i> time, from morning till night,
with persons who taught him to walk, to ride, to talk, to think
like a man&mdash;a foolish man, instead of a wise child, as
nature designed him to be.</p>
<p>This unfortunate youth was never permitted to have one
conception of his own&mdash;all were taught him&mdash;he was
never once asked, &ldquo;What he thought;&rdquo; but men were
paid to tell &ldquo;how to think.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was taught to
revere such and such persons, however unworthy of his reverence;
to believe such and such things, however unworthy of his credit:
and to act so and so, on such and such occasions, however
unworthy of his feelings.</p>
<p>Such were the lessons of the tutors assigned him by his
father&mdash;those masters whom his mother gave him did him less
mischief; for though they distorted his limbs and made his
manners effeminate, they did not interfere beyond the body.</p>
<p>Mr. Norwynne (the family name of his father, and though but a
school-boy, he was called <i>Mister</i>) could talk on history,
on politics, and on religion; surprisingly to all who never
listened to a parrot or magpie&mdash;for he merely repeated what
had been told to him without one reflection upon the sense or
probability of his report.&nbsp; He had been praised for his
memory; and to continue that praise, he was so anxious to retain
every sentence he had heard, or he had read, that the poor
creature had no time for one native idea, but could only
re-deliver his tutors&rsquo; lessons to his father, and his
father&rsquo;s to his tutors.&nbsp; But, whatever he said or did,
was the admiration of all who came to the house of the dean, and
who knew he was an only child.&nbsp; Indeed, considering the
labour that was taken to spoil him, he was rather a commendable
youth; for, with the pedantic folly of his teachers, the blind
affection of his father and mother, the obsequiousness of the
servants, and flattery of the visitors, it was some credit to him
that he was not an idiot, or a brute&mdash;though when he
imitated the manners of a man, he had something of the latter in
his appearance; for he would grin and bow to a lady, catch her
fan in haste when it fell, and hand her to her coach, as
thoroughly void of all the sentiment which gives grace to such
tricks, as a monkey.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>One morning in winter, just as the dean, his wife, and darling
child, had finished their breakfast at their house in London, a
servant brought in a letter to his master, and said &ldquo;the
man waited for an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the man?&rdquo; cried the dean, with all that
terrifying dignity with which he never failed to address his
inferiors, especially such as waited on his person.</p>
<p>The servant replied with a servility of tone equal to the
haughty one of his master, &ldquo;he did not know; but that the
man looked like a sailor, and had a boy with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A begging letter, no doubt,&rdquo; cried Lady
Clementina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it back,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;and bid him
send up word who he is, and what is his errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant went; and returning said, &ldquo;He comes from on
board a ship; his captain sent him, and his errand is, he
believes, to leave a boy he has brought with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy!&rdquo; cried the dean: &ldquo;what have I to do
with a boy?&nbsp; I expect no boy.&nbsp; What boy?&nbsp; What
age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks about twelve or thirteen,&rdquo; replied the
servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is mistaken in the house,&rdquo; said the
dean.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me look at the letter again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did look at it, and saw plainly it was directed to
himself.&nbsp; Upon a second glance, he had so perfect a
recollection of the hand, as to open it instantaneously; and,
after ordering the servant to withdraw, he read the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Zocotora Island</span>, <i>April</i> 6.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Dear Brother William,&mdash;It is a long time since
we have seen one another; but I hope not so long, that you have
quite forgotten the many happy days we once passed together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not take my leave of you when I left England,
because it would have been too much for me.&nbsp; I had met with
a great many sorrows just at that time; one of which was, the
misfortune of losing the use of my right hand by a fall from my
horse, which accident robbed me of most of my friends; for I
could no longer entertain them with my performance as I used to
do, and so I was ashamed to see them or you; and that was the
reason I came hither to try my fortune with some other
adventurers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have, I suppose, heard that the savages of the
island put our whole party to death.&nbsp; But it was my chance
to escape their cruelty.&nbsp; I was heart-broken for my
comrades; yet upon the whole, I do not know that the savages were
much to blame&mdash;we had no business to invade their
territories! and if they had invaded England, we should have done
the same by them.&nbsp; My life was spared, because, having
gained some little strength in my hand during the voyage, I
pleased their king when I arrived there with playing on my
violin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They spared my child too, in pity to my lamentations,
when they were going to put him to death.&nbsp; Now, dear
brother, before I say any more to you concerning my child, I will
first ask your pardon for any offence I may have ever given you
in all the time we lived so long together.&nbsp; I know you have
often found fault with me, and I dare say I have been very often
to blame; but I here solemnly declare that I never did anything
purposely to offend you, but mostly, all I could to oblige
you&mdash;and I can safely declare that I never bore you above a
quarter of an hour&rsquo;s resentment for anything you might say
to me which I thought harsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, dear William, after being in this island eleven
years, the weakness in my hand has unfortunately returned; and
yet there being no appearance of complaint, the uninformed
islanders think it is all my obstinacy, and that I <i>will
not</i> entertain them with my music, which makes me say that I
<i>cannot</i>; and they have imprisoned me, and threaten to put
my son to death if I persist in my stubbornness any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The anguish I feel in my mind takes away all hope of
the recovery of strength in my hand; and I have no doubt but that
they intend in a few days to put their horrid threat into
execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, dear brother William, hearing in my prison
of a most uncommon circumstance, which is, that an English vessel
is lying at a small distance from the island, I have entrusted a
faithful negro to take my child to the ship, and deliver him to
the captain, with a request that he may be sent (with this
letter) to you on the ship&rsquo;s arrival in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now my dear, dear brother William, in case the poor boy
should live to come to you, I have no doubt but you will receive
him; yet excuse a poor, fond father, if I say a word or two which
I hope may prove in his favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, my dear brother, do not think it the
child&rsquo;s fault, but mine, that you will find him so
ignorant&mdash;he has always shown a quickness and a willingness
to learn, and would, I dare say, if he had been brought up under
your care, have been by this time a good scholar, but you know I
am no scholar myself.&nbsp; Besides, not having any books here, I
have only been able to teach my child by talking to him, and in
all my conversations with him I have never taken much pains to
instruct him in the manners of my own country; thinking, that if
ever he went over, he would learn them soon enough; and if he
never <i>did</i> go over, that it would be as well he knew
nothing about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have kept him also from the knowledge of everything
which I have thought pernicious in the conduct of the savages,
except that I have now and then pointed out a few of their
faults, in order to give him a true conception and a proper
horror of them.&nbsp; At the same time I have taught him to love,
and to do good to his neighbour, whoever that neighbour may be,
and whatever may be his failings.&nbsp; Falsehood of every kind I
included in this precept as forbidden, for no one can love his
neighbour and deceive him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have instructed him too, to hold in contempt all
frivolous vanity, and all those indulgences which he was never
likely to obtain.&nbsp; He has learnt all that I have undertaken
to teach him; but I am afraid you will yet think he has learned
too little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife, I fear, will be offended at his want of
politeness, and perhaps proper respect for a person of her rank:
but indeed he is very tractable, and can, without severity, be
amended of all his faults; and though you will find he has many,
yet, pray, my dear brother William, call to mind he has been a
dutiful and an affectionate child to me; and that had it pleased
Heaven we had lived together for many years to come, I verily
believe I should never have experienced one mark of his
disobedience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell for ever, my dear, dear brother
William&mdash;and if my poor, kind, affectionate child should
live to bring you this letter, sometimes speak to him of me and
let him know, that for twelve years he was my sole comfort; and
that, when I sent him from me, in order to save his life, I laid
down my head upon the floor of the cell in which I was confined,
and prayed that Heaven might end my days before the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the conclusion of the letter, except four or five
lines which (with his name) were so much blotted, apparently with
tears, that they were illegible.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>While the dean was reading to himself this letter, his
countenance frequently changed, and once or twice the tears
streamed from his eyes.&nbsp; When it was finished, he
exclaimed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother has sent his child to me, and I will be a
parent to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was rushing towards the door, when
Lady Clementina stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it proper, do you think, Mr. Dean, that all the
servants in the house should be witnesses to your meeting with
your brother and your nephew in the state in which they must be
at present?&nbsp; Send for them into a private
apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother!&rdquo; cried the dean; &ldquo;oh! that it
<i>were</i> my brother!&nbsp; The man is merely a person from the
ship, who has conducted his child hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell was rung, money was sent to the man, and orders given
that the boy should be shown up immediately.</p>
<p>While young Henry was walking up the stairs, the dean&rsquo;s
wife was weighing in her mind in what manner it would most
redound to her honour to receive him; for her vanity taught her
to believe that the whole inquisitive world pried into her
conduct, even upon every family occurrence.</p>
<p>Young William was wondering to himself what kind of an
unpolished monster his beggarly cousin would appear; and was
contemplating how much the poor youth would be surprised, and
awed by his superiority.</p>
<p>The dean felt no other sensation than an impatient desire of
beholding the child.</p>
<p>The door opened&mdash;and the son of his brother Henry, of his
benefactor, entered.</p>
<p>The habit he had on when he left his father, having been of
slight texture, was worn out by the length of the voyage, and he
was in the dress of a sailor-boy.&nbsp; Though about the same age
with his cousin, he was something taller: and though a strong
family resemblance appeared between the two youths, he was
handsomer than William; and from a simplicity spread over his
countenance, a quick impatience in his eye&mdash;which denoted
anxious curiosity, and childish surprise at every new object
which presented itself&mdash;he appeared younger than his
well-informed and well-bred cousin.</p>
<p>He walked into the room, not with a dictated obeisance, but
with a hurrying step, a half pleased, yet a half frightened look,
an instantaneous survey of every person present; not as demanding
&ldquo;what they thought of him,&rdquo; but expressing almost as
plainly as in direct words, &ldquo;what he thought of
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; For all alarm in respect to his safety and
reception seemed now wholly forgotten, in the curiosity which the
sudden sight of strangers such as he had never seen in his life
before, excited: and as to <i>himself</i>, he did not appear to
know there was such a person existing: his whole faculties were
absorbed in <i>others</i>.</p>
<p>The dean&rsquo;s reception of him did honour to his
sensibility and his gratitude to his brother.&nbsp; After the
first affectionate gaze, he ran to him, took him in his arms, sat
down, drew him to him, held him between his knees, and repeatedly
exclaimed, &ldquo;I will repay to you all I owe to your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, in return, hugged the dean round the neck, kissed
him, and exclaimed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! you <i>are</i> my father&mdash;you have just such
eyes, and such a forehead&mdash;indeed you would be almost the
same as he, if it were not for that great white thing which grows
upon your head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let the reader understand, that the dean, fondly attached to
every ornament of his dignified function, was never seen (unless
caught in bed) without an enormous wig.&nbsp; With this young
Henry was enormously struck; having never seen so unbecoming a
decoration, either in the savage island from whence he came, or
on board the vessel in which he sailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine,&rdquo; cried his uncle, laying his hand
gently on the reverend habiliment, &ldquo;that this
grows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is on <i>my</i> head grows,&rdquo; said young
Henry, &ldquo;and so does that which is upon my
father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now you are come to Europe, Henry, you will see
many persons with such things as these, which they put on and
take off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you wear such things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a distinction between us and inferior people: they
are worn to give an importance to the wearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just as the savages do; they hang brass
nails, wire, buttons, and entrails of beasts all over them, to
give them importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean now led his nephew to Lady Clementina, and told him,
&ldquo;She was his aunt, to whom he must behave with the utmost
respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, I will,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;for she, I
see, is a person of importance too; she has, very nearly, such a
white thing upon her head as you have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His aunt had not yet fixed in what manner it would be
advisable to behave; whether with intimidating grandeur, or with
amiable tenderness.&nbsp; While she was hesitating between both,
she felt a kind of jealous apprehension that her son was not so
engaging either in his person or address as his cousin; and
therefore she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, Dean, the arrival of this child will give you a
still higher sense of the happiness we enjoy in our own.&nbsp;
What an instructive contrast between the manners of the one and
of the other!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the child&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; returned the
dean, &ldquo;that he is not so elegant in his manners as his
cousin.&nbsp; Had William been bred in the same place, he would
have been as unpolished as this boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said young William with
a formal bow and a sarcastic smile, &ldquo;I assure you several
of my tutors have told me, that I appear to know many things as
it were by instinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Henry fixed his eyes upon his cousin, while, with steady
self-complacency, he delivered this speech, and no sooner was it
concluded than Henry cried out in a kind of wonder,</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little man! as I am alive, a little man!&nbsp; I did
not know there were such little men in this country!&nbsp; I
never saw one in my life before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a boy,&rdquo; said the dean; &ldquo;a boy not
older than yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put their hands together, and William gravely shook hands
with his cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a man,&rdquo; continued young Henry; then
stroked his cousin&rsquo;s chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, I do not
know whether it is or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you again,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;he is a
boy of your own age; you and he are cousins, for I am his
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; said young Henry.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He called you <i>Sir</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this country,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;polite
children do not call their parents <i>father</i> and
<i>mother</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t they sometimes forget to love them as
such?&rdquo; asked Henry.</p>
<p>His uncle became now impatient to interrogate him in every
particular concerning his father&rsquo;s state.&nbsp; Lady
Clementina felt equal impatience to know where the father was,
whether he were coming to live with them, wanted anything of
them, and every circumstance in which her vanity was
interested.&nbsp; Explanations followed all these questions; but
which, exactly agreeing with what the elder Henry&rsquo;s letter
has related, require no recital here.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>That vanity which presided over every thought and deed of Lady
Clementina was the protector of young Henry within her
house.&nbsp; It represented to her how amiable her conduct would
appear in the eye of the world should she condescend to treat
this destitute nephew as her own son; what envy such heroic
virtue would excite in the hearts of her particular friends, and
what grief in the bosoms of all those who did not like her.</p>
<p>The dean was a man of no inconsiderable penetration.&nbsp; He
understood the thoughts which, upon this occasion, passed in the
mind of his wife, and in order to ensure her kind treatment of
the boy, instead of reproaching her for the cold manner in which
she had at first received him, he praised her tender and
sympathetic heart for having shown him so much kindness, and thus
stimulated her vanity to be praised still more.</p>
<p>William, the mother&rsquo;s own son, far from apprehending a
rival in this savage boy, was convinced of his own pre-eminence,
and felt an affection for him&mdash;though rather as a foil than
as a cousin.&nbsp; He sported with his ignorance upon all
occasions, and even lay in wait for circumstances that might
expose it; while young Henry, strongly impressed with everything
which appeared new to him, expressed, without reserve, the
sensations which those novelties excited, wholly careless of the
construction put on his observations.</p>
<p>He never appeared either offended or abashed when laughed at;
but still pursued his questions, and still discovered his wonder
at many replies made to him, though &ldquo;simpleton,&rdquo;
&ldquo;poor silly boy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;idiot,&rdquo; were
vociferated around him from his cousin, his aunt, and their
constant visitor the bishop.</p>
<p>His uncle would frequently undertake to instruct him; so
indeed would the bishop; but Lady Clementina, her son, and the
greatest part of her companions, found something so irresistibly
ridiculous in his remarks, that nothing but immoderate laughter
followed; they thought such folly had even merit in the way of
entertainment, and they wished him no wiser.</p>
<p>Having been told that every morning, on first seeing his
uncle, he was to make a respectful bow; and coming into the
dean&rsquo;s dressing-room just as he was out of bed, his wig
lying on the table, Henry appeared at a loss which of the two he
should bow to.&nbsp; At last he gave the preference to his uncle,
but afterwards bowed reverently to the wig.&nbsp; In this he did
what he conceived was proper, from the introduction which the
dean, on his first arrival, had given him to this venerable
stranger; for, in reality, Henry had a contempt for all finery,
and had called even his aunt&rsquo;s jewels, when they were first
shown to him, &ldquo;trumpery,&rdquo; asking &ldquo;what they
were good for?&rdquo;&nbsp; But being corrected in this
disrespect, and informed of their high value, he, like a good
convert, gave up his reason to his faith; and becoming, like all
converts, over-zealous, he now believed there was great worth in
all gaudy appearances, and even respected the earrings of Lady
Clementina almost as much as he respected herself.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>It was to be lamented that when young Henry had been several
months in England, had been taught to read, and had, of course,
in the society in which he lived, seen much of the enlightened
world, yet the natural expectation of his improvement was by no
means answered.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the sensibility, which upon various occasions
he manifested in the most captivating degree, notwithstanding the
seeming gentleness of his nature upon all occasions, there now
appeared, in most of his inquiries and remarks, a something which
demonstrated either a stupid or troublesome disposition; either
dulness of conception, or an obstinacy of perseverance in
comments and in arguments which were glaringly false.</p>
<p>Observing his uncle one day offended with his coachman, and
hearing him say to him in a very angry tone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall never drive me again&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>The moment the man quitted the room, Henry (with his eyes
fixed in the deepest contemplation) repeated five or six times,
in a half whisper to himself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You shall never drive me again</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You shall never drive me again</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean at last called to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean
by thus repeating my words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am trying to find out what <i>you</i> meant,&rdquo;
said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; cried his enlightened
cousin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Richard is turned away; he is never to get
upon our coach-box again, never to drive any of us
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was it pleasure to drive us, cousin?&nbsp; I am
sure I have often pitied him.&nbsp; It rained sometimes very hard
when he was on the box; and sometimes Lady Clementina has kept
him a whole hour at the door all in the cold and snow.&nbsp; Was
that pleasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied young William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it honour, cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; exclaimed his cousin with a contemptuous
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did my uncle say to him, as a punishment,
&lsquo;he should never&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come hither, child,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;and
let me instruct you; your father&rsquo;s negligence has been
inexcusable.&nbsp; There are in society,&rdquo; continued the
dean, &ldquo;rich and poor; the poor are born to serve the
rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are the rich born for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be served by the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose the poor would not serve them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they must starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so poor people are permitted to live only upon
condition that they wait upon the rich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that a hard condition; or if it were, they will be
rewarded in a better world than this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a better world than this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible you do not know there is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard my father once say something about a world to
come; but he stopped short, and said I was too young to
understand what he meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world to come,&rdquo; returned the dean, &ldquo;is
where we shall go after death; and there no distinction will be
made between rich and poor&mdash;all persons there will be
equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, now I see what makes it a better world than
this.&nbsp; But cannot this world try to be as good as
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In respect to placing all persons on a level, it is
utterly impossible.&nbsp; God has ordained it
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How! has God ordained a distinction to be made, and
will not make any Himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean did not proceed in his instructions.&nbsp; He now
began to think his brother in the right, and that the boy was too
young, or too weak, to comprehend the subject.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>In addition to his ignorant conversation upon many topics,
young Henry had an incorrigible misconception and misapplication
of many <i>words</i>.&nbsp; His father having had but few
opportunities of discoursing with him, upon account of his
attendance at the court of the savages, and not having books in
the island, he had consequently many words to learn of this
country&rsquo;s language when he arrived in England.&nbsp; This
task his retentive memory made easy to him; but his childish
inattention to their proper signification still made his want of
education conspicuous.</p>
<p>He would call <i>compliments</i>, <i>lies</i>; <i>reserve</i>,
he would call <i>pride</i>; <i>stateliness</i>,
<i>affectation</i>; and for the words <i>war</i> and
<i>battle</i>, he constantly substituted the word
<i>massacre</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said William to his father one morning, as
he entered the room, &ldquo;do you hear how the cannons are
firing, and the bells ringing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I dare say,&rdquo; cried Henry, &ldquo;there has
been another massacre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean called to him in anger, &ldquo;Will you never learn
the right use of words?&nbsp; You mean to say a
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is a massacre?&rdquo; cried the frightened,
but still curious Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A massacre,&rdquo; replied his uncle, &ldquo;is when a
number of people are slain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; returned Henry, &ldquo;soldiers had
been people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You interrupted me,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;before
I finished my sentence.&nbsp; Certainly, both soldiers and
sailors are people, but they engage to die by their own free will
and consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! all of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the rest are massacred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean answered, &ldquo;The number who go to battle
unwillingly, and by force, are few; and for the others, they have
previously sold their lives to the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For soldiers&rsquo; and sailors&rsquo; pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father used to tell me, we must not take away our
own lives; but he forgot to tell me we might sell them for others
to take away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; said the dean to his son, his patience
tired with his nephew&rsquo;s persevering nonsense,
&ldquo;explain to your cousin the difference between a battle and
a massacre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A massacre,&rdquo; said William, rising from his seat,
and fixing his eyes alternately upon his father, his mother, and
the bishop (all of whom were present) for their approbation,
rather than the person&rsquo;s to whom his instructions were to
be addressed&mdash;&ldquo;a massacre,&rdquo; said William,
&ldquo;is when human beings are slain, who have it not in their
power to defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear cousin William,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;that
must ever be the case with every one who is killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short hesitation, William replied: &ldquo;In massacres
people are put to death for no crime, but merely because they are
objects of suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in battle,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;the persons
put to death are not even suspected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bishop now condescended to end this disputation by saying
emphatically,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider, young savage, that in battle neither the
infant, the aged, the sick, nor infirm are involved, but only
those in the full prime of health and vigour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As this argument came from so great and reverend a man as the
bishop, Henry was obliged, by a frown from his uncle, to submit,
as one refuted; although he had an answer at the veriest tip of
his tongue, which it was torture to him not to utter.&nbsp; What
he wished to say must ever remain a secret.&nbsp; The church has
its terrors as well as the law; and Henry was awed by the
dean&rsquo;s tremendous wig as much as Paternoster Row is awed by
the Attorney-General.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p>If the dean had loved his wife but moderately, seeing all her
faults clearly as he did, he must frequently have quarrelled with
her: if he had loved her with tenderness, he must have treated
her with a degree of violence in the hope of amending her
failings.&nbsp; But having neither personal nor mental affection
towards her sufficiently interesting to give himself the trouble
to contradict her will in anything, he passed for one of the best
husbands in the world.&nbsp; Lady Clementina went out when she
liked, stayed at home when she liked, dressed as she liked, and
talked as she liked without a word of disapprobation from her
husband, and all&mdash;because he cared nothing about her.</p>
<p>Her vanity attributed this indulgence to inordinate affection;
and observers in general thought her happier in her marriage than
the beloved wife who bathes her pillow with tears by the side of
an angry husband, whose affection is so excessive that he
unkindly upbraids her because she is&mdash;less than
perfection.</p>
<p>The dean&rsquo;s wife was not so dispassionately considered by
some of his acquaintance as by himself; for they would now and
then hint at her foibles: but this great liberty she also
conceived to be the effect of most violent love, or most violent
admiration: and such would have been her construction had they
commended her follies&mdash;had they totally slighted, or had
they beaten her.</p>
<p>Amongst those acquaintances, the aforesaid bishop, by far the
most frequent visitor, did not come merely to lounge an idle
hour, but he had a more powerful motive; the desire of fame, and
dread of being thought a man receiving large emolument for
unimportant service.</p>
<p>The dean, if he did not procure him the renown he wished,
still preserved him from the apprehended censure.</p>
<p>The elder William was to his negligent or ignorant superiors
in the church such as an apt boy at school is to the rich
dunces&mdash;William performed the prelates&rsquo; tasks for
them, and they rewarded him&mdash;not indeed with toys or money,
but with their countenance, their company, their praise.&nbsp;
And scarcely was there a sermon preached from the patrician part
of the bench, in which the dean did not fashion some periods,
blot out some uncouth phrases, render some obscure sentiments
intelligible, and was the certain person, when the work was
printed, to correct the press.</p>
<p>This honourable and right reverend bishop delighted in
printing and publishing his works; or rather the entire works of
the dean, which passed for his: and so degradingly did William,
the shopkeeper&rsquo;s son, think of his own homiest extraction,
that he was blinded, even to the loss of honour, by the lustre of
this noble acquaintance; for, though in other respects he was a
man of integrity, yet, when the gratification of his friend was
in question, he was a liar; he not only disowned his giving him
aid in any of his publications, but he never published anything
in his own name without declaring to the world &ldquo;that he had
been obliged for several hints on the subject, for many of the
most judicious corrections, and for those passages in page so and
so (naming the most eloquent parts of the work) to his noble and
learned friend the bishop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean&rsquo;s wife being a fine lady&mdash;while her
husband and his friend pored over books or their own manuscripts
at home, she ran from house to house, from public amusement to
public amusement; but much less for the pleasure of <i>seeing</i>
than for that of being seen.&nbsp; Nor was it material to her
enjoyment whether she were observed, or welcomed, where she went,
as she never entertained the smallest doubt of either; but rested
assured that her presence roused curiosity and dispensed gladness
all around.</p>
<p>One morning she went forth to pay her visits, all smiles, such
as she thought captivating: she returned, all tears, such as she
thought no less endearing.</p>
<p>Three ladies accompanied her home, entreating her to be
patient under a misfortune to which even kings are liable:
namely, defamation.</p>
<p>Young Henry, struck with compassion at grief of which he knew
not the cause, begged to know &ldquo;what was the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inhuman monsters, to treat a woman thus!&rdquo; cried
his aunt in a fury, casting the corner of her eye into a
looking-glass, to see how rage became her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, comfort yourself,&rdquo; said one of her
companions: &ldquo;few people will believe you merit the
charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But few! if only one believe it, I shall call my
reputation lost, and I will shut myself up in some lonely hut,
and for ever renounce all that is dear to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! all your fine clothes?&rdquo; said Henry, in
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what importance will my best dresses be, when nobody
would see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would see them yourself, dear aunt; and I am sure
nobody admires them more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you speak of that,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I do not
think this gown I have on becoming&mdash;I am sure I
look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean, with the bishop (to whom he had been reading a
treatise just going to the press, which was to be published in
the name of the latter, though written by the former), now
entered, to inquire why they had been sent for in such haste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dean! oh, my Lord Bishop!&rdquo; she cried,
resuming that grief which the thoughts of her dress had for a
time dispelled&mdash;&ldquo;My reputation is destroyed&mdash;a
public print has accused me of playing deep at my own house, and
winning all the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world will never reform,&rdquo; said the bishop:
&ldquo;all our labour, my friend, is thrown away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it possible,&rdquo; cried the dean, &ldquo;that
any one has dared to say this of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is in print,&rdquo; said she, holding out a
newspaper.</p>
<p>The dean read the paragraph, and then exclaimed, &ldquo;I can
forgive a falsehood <i>spoken</i>&mdash;the warmth of
conversation may excuse it&mdash;but to <i>write</i> and
<i>print</i> an untruth is unpardonable, and I will prosecute
this publisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still the falsehood will go down to posterity,&rdquo;
said Lady Clementina; &ldquo;and after ages will think I was a
gambler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comfort yourself, dear madam,&rdquo; said young Henry,
wishing to console her: &ldquo;perhaps after ages may not hear of
you; nor even the present age think much about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bishop now exclaimed, after having taken the paper from
the dean, and read the paragraph, &ldquo;It is a libel, a rank
libel, and the author must be punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only the author, but the publisher,&rdquo; said the
dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only the publisher, but the printer,&rdquo;
continued the bishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And must my name be bandied about by lawyers in a
common court of justice?&rdquo; cried Lady Clementina.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How shocking to my delicacy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lord, it is a pity we cannot try them by the
ecclesiastical court,&rdquo; said the dean, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or by the India delinquent bill,&rdquo; said the
bishop, with vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So totally innocent as I am!&rdquo; she vociferated
with sobs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every one knows I never touch a card at
home, and this libel charges me with playing at my own house; and
though, whenever I do play, I own I am apt to win, yet it is
merely for my amusement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Win or not win, play or not play,&rdquo; exclaimed both
the churchmen, &ldquo;this is a libel&mdash;no doubt, no doubt, a
libel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Henry&rsquo;s confined knowledge of his native language
tormented him so much with curiosity upon this occasion, that he
went softly up to his uncle, and asked him in a whisper,
&ldquo;What is the meaning of the word libel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A libel,&rdquo; replied the dean, in a raised voice,
&ldquo;is that which one person publishes to the injury of
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what can the injured person do,&rdquo; asked Henry,
&ldquo;if the accusation should chance to be true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prosecute,&rdquo; replied the dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, then, what does he do if the accusation be
false?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prosecute likewise,&rdquo; answered the dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, uncle! is it possible that the innocent behave
just like the guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no other way to act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, if I were the innocent, I would do nothing
at all sooner than I would act like the guilty.&nbsp; I would not
persecute&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said <i>prosecute</i>,&rdquo; cried the dean in
anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leave the room; you have no
comprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, now I understand the difference of the two
words; but they sound so much alike, I did not at first observe
the distinction.&nbsp; You said, &lsquo;the innocent prosecute,
but the <i>guilty persecute</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; He bowed
(convinced as he thought) and left the room.</p>
<p>After this modern star-chamber, which was left sitting, had
agreed on its mode of vengeance, and the writer of the libel was
made acquainted with his danger, he waited, in all humility, upon
Lady Clementina, and assured her, with every appearance of
sincerity,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she was not the person alluded to by the paragraph
in question, but that the initials which she had conceived to
mark out her name, were, in fact, meant to point out Lady
Catherine Newland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; cried Lady Clementina, &ldquo;what
could induce you to write such a paragraph upon Lady
Catherine?&nbsp; She <i>never</i> plays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that, madam, or we dared not to have attacked
her.&nbsp; Though we must circulate libels, madam, to gratify our
numerous readers, yet no people are more in fear of prosecutions
than authors and editors; therefore, unless we are deceived in
our information, we always take care to libel the
innocent&mdash;we apprehend nothing from them&mdash;their own
characters support them&mdash;but the guilty are very tenacious;
and what they cannot secure by fair means, they will employ force
to accomplish.&nbsp; Dear madam, be assured I have too much
regard for a wife and seven small children, who are maintained by
my industry alone, to have written anything in the nature of a
libel upon your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p>About this period the dean had just published a pamphlet in
his own name, and in which that of his friend the bishop was only
mentioned with thanks for hints, observations, and condescending
encouragement to the author.</p>
<p>This pamphlet glowed with the dean&rsquo;s love for his
country; and such a country as he described, it was impossible
<i>not</i> to love.&nbsp; &ldquo;Salubrious air, fertile fields,
wood, water, corn, grass, sheep, oxen, fish, fowl, fruit, and
vegetables,&rdquo; were dispersed with the most prodigal hand;
&ldquo;valiant men, virtuous women; statesmen wise and just;
tradesmen abounding in merchandise and money; husbandmen
possessing peace, ease, plenty; and all ranks
liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; This brilliant description, while the dean
read the work to his family, so charmed poor Henry, that he
repeatedly cried out,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I came to this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it so happened that a few days after, Lady Clementina, in
order to render the delicacy of her taste admired, could eat of
no one dish upon the table, but found fault with them all.&nbsp;
The dean at length said to her,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you are too nice; reflect upon the hundreds of
poor creatures who have not a morsel or a drop of anything to
subsist upon, except bread and water; and even of the first a
scanty allowance, but for which they are obliged to toil six days
in the week, from sun to sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, uncle,&rdquo; cried Henry, &ldquo;in what country
do these poor people live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this country,&rdquo; replied the dean.</p>
<p>Henry rose from his chair, ran to the chimney-piece, took up
his uncle&rsquo;s pamphlet, and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
remember your mentioning them here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have not,&rdquo; answered the dean,
coolly.</p>
<p>Still Henry turned over each leaf of the book, but he could
meet only with luxurious details of &ldquo;the fruits of the
earth, the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the
fishes of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here is provision enough for all the
people,&rdquo; said Henry; &ldquo;why should they want? why do
not they go and take some of these things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must not,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;unless they
were their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, uncle! does no part of the earth, nor anything
which the earth produces, belong to the poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did not you say so, then, in your
pamphlet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is what everybody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then, what you have said in your pamphlet is only
what&mdash;nobody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There appeared to the dean, in the delivery of this sentence,
a satirical acrimony, which his irritability as an author could
but ill forgive.</p>
<p>An author, it is said, has more acute feelings in respect to
his works than any artist in the world besides.</p>
<p>Henry had some cause, on the present occasion, to think this
observation just; for no sooner had he spoken the foregoing
words, than his uncle took him by the hand out of the room, and,
leading him to his study, there he enumerated his various faults;
and having told him &ldquo;it was for all those, too long
permitted with impunity, and not merely for the <i>present</i>
impertinence, that he meant to punish him,&rdquo; ordered him to
close confinement in his chamber for a week.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the dean&rsquo;s pamphlet (less hurt by
Henry&rsquo;s critique than <i>he</i> had been) was proceeding to
the tenth edition, and the author acquiring literary reputation
beyond what he had ever conferred on his friend the bishop.</p>
<p>The style, the energy, the eloquence of the work was echoed by
every reader who could afford to buy it&mdash;some few
enlightened ones excepted, who chiefly admired the author&rsquo;s
<i>invention</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p>The dean, in the good humour which the rapid sale of his book
produced, once more took his nephew to his bosom; and although
the ignorance of young Henry upon the late occasions had offended
him very highly, yet that self-same ignorance, evinced a short
time after upon a different subject, struck his uncle as
productive of a most rare and exalted virtue.</p>
<p>Henry had frequently, in his conversation, betrayed the total
want of all knowledge in respect to religion or futurity, and the
dean for this reason delayed taking him to church, till he had
previously given him instructions <i>wherefore</i> he went.</p>
<p>A leisure morning arrived, on which he took his nephew to his
study, and implanted in his youthful mind the first unconfused
idea of the Creator of the universe!</p>
<p>The dean was eloquent, Henry was all attention; his
understanding, expanded by time to the conception of a
God&mdash;and not warped by custom from the sensations which a
just notion of that God inspires&mdash;dwelt with delight and
wonder on the information given him&mdash;lessons which,
instilled into the head of a senseless infant, too often produce,
throughout his remaining life, an impious indifference to the
truths revealed.</p>
<p>Yet, with all that astonished, that respectful sensibility
which Henry showed on this great occasion, he still expressed his
opinion, and put questions to the dean, with his usual
simplicity, till he felt himself convinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried he&mdash;after being informed of the
attributes inseparable from the Supreme Being, and having
received the injunction to offer prayers to Him night and
morning&mdash;&ldquo;What! am I permitted to speak to Power
Divine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all times,&rdquo; replied the dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How! whenever I like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you like,&rdquo; returned the dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I durst not,&rdquo; cried Henry, &ldquo;make so free
with the bishop, nor dare any of his attendants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bishop,&rdquo; said the dean, &ldquo;is the servant
of God, and therefore must be treated with respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With more respect than his Master?&rdquo; asked
Henry.</p>
<p>The dean not replying immediately to this question, Henry, in
the rapidity of inquiry, ran on to another:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what am I to say when I speak to the
Almighty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, thank Him for the favours He has bestowed on
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What favours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You amaze me,&rdquo; cried the dean, &ldquo;by your
question.&nbsp; Do not you live in ease, in plenty, and
happiness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do the poor and the unhappy thank Him too,
uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt; every human being glorifies Him, for having
been made a rational creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does my aunt and all her card-parties glorify Him
for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean again made no reply, and Henry went on to other
questions, till his uncle had fully instructed him as to the
nature and the form of <i>prayer</i>; and now, putting into his
hands a book, he pointed out to him a few short prayers, which he
wished him to address to Heaven in his presence.</p>
<p>Whilst Henry bent his knees, as his uncle had directed, he
trembled, turned pale, and held, for a slight support, on the
chair placed before him.</p>
<p>His uncle went to him, and asked him &ldquo;What was the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Henry, &ldquo;when I first came to
your door with my poor father&rsquo;s letter, I shook for fear
you would not look upon me; and I cannot help feeling even more
now than I did then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean embraced him with warmth&mdash;gave him
confidence&mdash;and retired to the other side of the study, to
observe his whole demeanour on this new occasion.</p>
<p>As he beheld his features varying between the passions of
humble fear and fervent hope, his face sometimes glowing with the
rapture of thanksgiving, and sometimes with the blushes of
contrition, he thus exclaimed apart:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the true education on which to found the
principles of religion.&nbsp; The favour conferred by Heaven in
granting the freedom of petitions to its throne, can never be
conceived with proper force but by those whose most tedious
moments during their infancy were <i>not</i> passed in
prayer.&nbsp; Unthinking governors of childhood! to insult the
Deity with a form of worship in which the mind has no share; nay,
worse, has repugnance, and by the thoughtless habits of youth,
prevent, even in age, devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s attention was so firmly fixed that he forgot
there was a spectator of his fervour; nor did he hear young
William enter the chamber and even speak to his father.</p>
<p>At length closing his book and rising from his knees, he
approached his uncle and cousin, with a sedateness in his air,
which gave the latter a very false opinion of the state of his
youthful companion&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Mr. Henry,&rdquo; cried William, &ldquo;you have
been obliged, at last, to say your prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean informed his son &ldquo;that to Henry it was no
punishment to pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the strangest boy I ever knew!&rdquo; said
William, inadvertently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;I was frightened
when I first knelt; but when I came to the words, <i>Father</i>,
<i>which art in Heaven</i>, they gave me courage; for I know how
merciful and kind a <i>father</i> is, beyond any one
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean again embraced his nephew, let fall a tear to his
poor brother Henry&rsquo;s misfortunes; and admonished the youth
to show himself equally submissive to other instructions, as he
had done to those which inculcate piety.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p>The interim between youth and manhood was passed by young
William and young Henry in studious application to literature;
some casual mistakes in our customs and manners on the part of
Henry; some too close adherences to them on the side of
William.</p>
<p>Their different characters, when boys, were preserved when
they became men: Henry still retained that natural simplicity
which his early destiny had given him; he wondered still at many
things he saw and heard, and at times would venture to give his
opinion, contradict, and even act in opposition to persons whom
long experience and the approbation of the world had placed in
situations which claimed his implicit reverence and
submission.</p>
<p>Unchanged in all his boyish graces, young William, now a man,
was never known to infringe upon the statutes of good-breeding;
even though sincerity, his own free will, duty to his neighbour,
with many other plebeian virtues and privileges, were the
sacrifice.</p>
<p>William inherited all the pride and ambition of the
dean&mdash;Henry, all his father&rsquo;s humility.&nbsp; And yet,
so various and extensive is the acceptation of the word pride,
that, on some occasions, Henry was proud even beyond his
cousin.&nbsp; He thought it far beneath his dignity ever to
honour, or contemplate with awe, any human being in whom he saw
numerous failings.&nbsp; Nor would he, to ingratiate himself into
the favour of a man above him, stoop to one servility, such as
the haughty William daily practised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I am called proud,&rdquo; one day said William
to Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear cousin,&rdquo; replied Henry, &ldquo;it must be
only, then, by those who do not know you; for to me you appear
the humblest creature in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain of it; or would you always give up your
opinion to that of persons in a superior state, however inferior
in their understanding?&nbsp; Would else their weak judgment
immediately change yours, though, before, you had been decided on
the opposite side?&nbsp; Now, indeed, cousin, I have more pride
than you; for I never will stoop to act or to speak contrary to
my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will never be a great man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor ever desire it, if I must first be a mean
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was in the reputation of these two young men another
mistake, which the common retailers of character committed.&nbsp;
Henry was said to be wholly negligent, while William was reputed
to be extremely attentive to the other sex.&nbsp; William,
indeed, was gallant, was amorous, and indulged his inclination to
the libertine society of women; but Henry it was who <i>loved</i>
them.&nbsp; He admired them at a reverential distance, and felt
so tender an affection for the virtuous female, that it shocked
him to behold, much more to associate with, the depraved and
vicious.</p>
<p>In the advantages of person Henry was still superior to
William; and yet the latter had no common share of those
attractions which captivate weak, thoughtless, or unskilful
minds.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p>About the time that Henry and William quitted college, and had
arrived at their twentieth year, the dean purchased a small
estate in a village near to the country residence of Lord and
Lady Bendham; and, in the total want of society, the dean&rsquo;s
family were frequently honoured with invitations from the great
house.</p>
<p>Lord Bendham, besides a good estate, possessed the office of a
lord of the bed-chamber to his Majesty.&nbsp; Historians do not
ascribe much importance to the situation, or to the talents of
nobles in this department, nor shall this little history.&nbsp; A
lord of the bed-chamber is a personage well known in courts, and
in all capitals where courts reside; with this advantage to the
inquirer, that in becoming acquainted with one of those noble
characters, he becomes acquainted with all the remainder; not
only with those of the same kingdom, but those of foreign
nations; for, in whatever land, in whatever climate, a lord of
the bed-chamber must necessarily be the self-same creature: one
wholly made up of observance, of obedience, of dependence, and of
imitation&mdash;a borrowed character&mdash;a character formed by
reflection.</p>
<p>The wife of this illustrious peer, as well as himself, took
her hue, like the chameleon, from surrounding objects: her
manners were not governed by her mind but were solely directed by
external circumstances.&nbsp; At court, humble, resigned,
patient, attentive: at balls, masquerades, gaming-tables, and
routs, gay, sprightly, and flippant; at her country seat,
reserved, austere, arrogant, and gloomy.</p>
<p>Though in town her timid eye in presence of certain personages
would scarcely uplift its trembling lid, so much she felt her own
insignificance, yet, in the country, till Lady Clementina
arrived, there was not one being of consequence enough to share
in her acquaintance; and she paid back to her inferiors there all
the humiliating slights, all the mortifications, which in London
she received from those to whom <i>she</i> was inferior.</p>
<p>Whether in town or country, it is but justice to acknowledge
that in her own person she was strictly chaste; but in the
country she extended that chastity even to the persons of others;
and the young woman who lost her virtue in the village of Anfield
had better have lost her life.&nbsp; Some few were now and then
found hanging or drowned, while no other cause could be assigned
for their despair than an imputation on the discretion of their
character, and dread of the harsh purity of Lady Bendham.&nbsp;
She would remind the parish priest of the punishment allotted for
female dishonour, and by her influence had caused many an unhappy
girl to do public penance in their own or the neighbouring
churches.</p>
<p>But this country rigour in town she could dispense withal;
and, like other ladies of virtue, she there visited and received
into her house the acknowledged mistresses of any man in elevated
life.&nbsp; It was not, therefore, the crime, but the rank which
the criminal held in society, that drew down Lady Bendham&rsquo;s
vengeance.&nbsp; She even carried her distinction of classes in
female error to such a very nice point that the adulterous
concubine of an elder brother was her most intimate acquaintance,
whilst the less guilty unmarried mistress of the younger she
would not sully her lips to exchange a word with.</p>
<p>Lord and Lady Bendham&rsquo;s birth, education, talents, and
propensities, being much on the same scale of eminence, they
would have been a very happy pair, had not one great misfortune
intervened&mdash;the lady never bore her lord a child, while
every cottage of the village was crammed with half-starved
children, whose father from week to week, from year to year,
exerted his manly youth, and wasted his strength in vain, to
protect them from hunger; whose mother mourned over her new-born
infant as a little wretch, sent into the world to deprive the
rest of what already was too scanty for them; in the castle,
which owned every cottage and all the surrounding land, and where
one single day of feasting would have nourished for a mouth all
the poor inhabitants of the parish, not one child was given to
partake of the plenty.&nbsp; The curse of barrenness was on the
family of the lord of the manor, the curse of fruitfulness upon
the famished poor.</p>
<p>This lord and lady, with an ample fortune, both by inheritance
and their sovereign&rsquo;s favour, had never yet the economy to
be exempt from debts; still, over their splendid, their profuse
table, they could contrive and plan excellent schemes &ldquo;how
the poor might live most comfortably with a little better
management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wages of a labouring man, with a wife and half a dozen
small children, Lady Bendham thought quite sufficient if they
would only learn a little economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, my lord, those people never want to
dress&mdash;shoes and stockings, a coat and waistcoat, a gown and
a cap, a petticoat and a handkerchief, are all they
want&mdash;fire, to be sure, in winter&mdash;then all the rest is
merely for provision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get a pen and ink,&rdquo; said young Henry,
one day, when he had the honour of being at their table,
&ldquo;and see what the <i>rest</i> amounts to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no accounts,&rdquo; cried my lord, &ldquo;no
summing up; but if you were to calculate, you must add to the
receipts of the poor my gift at Christmas&mdash;last year, during
the frost, no less than a hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How benevolent!&rdquo; exclaimed the dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How prudent!&rdquo; exclaimed Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by prudent?&rdquo; asked Lord
Bendham.&nbsp; &ldquo;Explain your meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my lord,&rdquo; replied the dean, &ldquo;do not ask
for an explanation: this youth is wholly unacquainted with our
customs, and, though a man in stature, is but a child in
intellects.&nbsp; Henry, have I not often cautioned
you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever his thoughts are upon the subject,&rdquo;
cried Lord Bendham, &ldquo;I desire to know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, my lord,&rdquo; answered Henry, &ldquo;I
thought it was prudent in you to give a little, lest the poor,
driven to despair, should take all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they had, they would have been
hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanging, my lord, our history, or some tradition, says,
was formerly adopted as a mild punishment, in place of
starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; cried Lady Bendham (who seldom spoke
directly to the argument before her), &ldquo;I am sure they ought
to think themselves much obliged to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the greatest hardship of all,&rdquo; cried
Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, sir?&rdquo; exclaimed the earl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;my uncle looks
displeased&mdash;I am very ignorant&mdash;I did not receive my
first education in this country&mdash;and I find I think so
differently from every one else, that I am ashamed to utter my
sentiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, young man,&rdquo; answered Lord Bendham;
&ldquo;we shall excuse your ignorance for once.&nbsp; Only inform
us what it was you just now called <i>the greatest hardship of
all</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was, my lord, that what the poor receive to keep
them from perishing should pass under the name of <i>gifts</i>
and <i>bounty</i>.&nbsp; Health, strength, and the will to earn a
moderate subsistence, ought to be every man&rsquo;s security from
obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a hundred pounds a great deal of money,&rdquo;
cried Lady Bendham; &ldquo;and I hope my lord will never give it
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so too,&rdquo; cried Henry; &ldquo;for if my
lord would only be so good as to speak a few words for the poor
as a senator, he might possibly for the future keep his hundred
pounds, and yet they never want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Bendham had the good nature only to smile at
Henry&rsquo;s simplicity, whispering to himself, &ldquo;I had
rather keep my&mdash;&rdquo; his last word was lost in the
whisper.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p>In the country&mdash;where the sensible heart is still more
susceptible of impressions; and where the unfeeling mind, in the
want of other men&rsquo;s wit to invent, forms schemes for its
own amusement&mdash;our youths both fell in love: if passions,
that were pursued on the most opposite principles, can receive
the same appellation.&nbsp; William, well versed in all the
licentious theory, thought himself in love, because he perceived
a tumultuous impulse cause his heart to beat while his fancy
fixed on a certain object whose presence agitated yet more his
breast.</p>
<p>Henry thought himself not in love, because, while he listened
to William on the subject, he found their sensations did not in
the least agree.</p>
<p>William owned to Henry that he loved Agnes, the daughter of a
cottager in the village, and hoped to make her his mistress.</p>
<p>Henry felt that his tender regard for Rebecca, the daughter of
the curate of the parish, did not inspire him even with the
boldness to acquaint her with his sentiments, much less to
meditate one design that might tend to her dishonour.</p>
<p>While William was cautiously planning how to meet in private,
and accomplish the seduction of the object of his passion, Henry
was endeavouring to fortify the object of <i>his</i> choice with
every virtue.&nbsp; He never read a book from which he received
improvement that he did not carry it to Rebecca&mdash;never heard
a circumstance which might assist towards her moral instruction
that he did not haste to tell it her; and once when William
boasted</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knew he was beloved by Agnes;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry said, with equal triumph, &ldquo;he had not dared to
take the means to learn, nor had Rebecca dared to give one
instance of her partiality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca was the youngest, and by far the least handsome
daughter of four, to whom the Reverend Mr. Rymer, a widower, was
father.&nbsp; The other sisters were accounted beauties; and she,
from her comparative want of personal charms, having been less
beloved by her parents, and less caressed by those who visited
them, than the rest, had for some time past sought other
resources of happiness than the affection, praise, and indulgence
of her fellow-creatures.&nbsp; The parsonage house in which this
family lived was the forlorn remains of an ancient abbey: it had
in later times been the habitation of a rich and learned rector,
by whom, at his decease, a library was bequeathed for the use of
every succeeding resident.&nbsp; Rebecca, left alone in this huge
ruinous abode, while her sisters were paying stated visits in
search of admiration, passed her solitary hours in reading.&nbsp;
She not merely read&mdash;she thought: the choicest English books
from this excellent library taught her to <i>think</i>; and
reflection fashioned her mind to bear the slights, the
mortifications of neglect, with a patient dejection, rather than
with an indignant or a peevish spirit.</p>
<p>This resignation to injury and contumely gave to her perfect
symmetry of person, a timid eye, a retiring manner, and spread
upon her face a placid sweetness, a pale serenity indicating
sense, which no wise connoisseur in female charms would have
exchanged for all the sparkling eyes and florid tints of her vain
and vulgar sisters.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;s soul was so enamoured of
her gentle deportment, that in his sight she appeared beautiful;
while she, with an understanding competent to judge of his worth,
was so greatly surprised, so prodigiously astonished at the
distinction, the attention, the many offices of civility paid her
by him, in preference to her idolised sisters, that her gratitude
for such unexpected favours had sometimes (even in his presence,
and in that of her family) nearly drowned her eyes with
tears.&nbsp; Yet they were only trifles, in which Henry had the
opportunity or the power to give her testimony of his
regard&mdash;trifles, often more grateful to the sensible mind
than efforts of high importance; and by which the proficient in
the human heart will accurately trace a passion wholly concealed
from the dull eye of the unskilled observer.</p>
<p>The first cause of amazement to Rebecca in the manners of
Henry was, that he talked with <i>her</i> as well as with her
sisters; no visitor else had done so.&nbsp; In appointing a
morning&rsquo;s or an evening&rsquo;s walk, he proposed
<i>her</i> going with the rest; no one had ever required her
company before.&nbsp; When he called and she was absent, he asked
where she was; no one had ever missed her before.&nbsp; She
thanked him most sincerely, and soon perceived that, at those
times when he was present, company was more pleasing even than
books.</p>
<p>Her astonishment, her gratitude, did not stop here.&nbsp;
Henry proceeded in attention; he soon selected her from her
sister to tell her the news of the day, answered her observations
the first; once gave her a sprig of myrtle from his bosom in
preference to another who had praised its beauty; and
once&mdash;never-to-be-forgotten kindness&mdash;sheltered her
from a hasty shower with his <i>parapluie</i>, while he lamented
to her drenched companions,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he had but <i>one</i> to offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a man whose understanding and person they admire, how
dear, how impressive on the female heart is every trait of
tenderness!&nbsp; Till now, Rebecca had experienced none; not
even of the parental kind: and merely from the overflowings of a
kind nature (not in return for affection) had she ever loved her
father and her sisters.&nbsp; Sometimes, repulsed by their
severity, she transferred the fulness of an affectionate heart
upon birds, or the brute creation: but now, her alienated mind
was recalled and softened by a sensation that made her long to
complain of the burthen it imposed.&nbsp; Those obligations which
exact silence are a heavy weight to the grateful; and Rebecca
longed to tell Henry &ldquo;that even the forfeit of her life
would be too little to express the full sense she had of the
respect he paid to her.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as modesty forbade not
only every kind of declaration, but every insinuation purporting
what she felt, she wept through sleepless nights from a load of
suppressed explanation; yet still she would not have exchanged
this trouble for all the beauty of her sisters.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p>Old John and Hannah Primrose, a prudent hardy couple, who, by
many years of peculiar labour and peculiar abstinence, were the
least poor of all the neighbouring cottagers, had an only child
(who has been named before) called Agnes: and this cottage girl
was reckoned, in spite of the beauty of the elder Miss Rymers, by
far the prettiest female in the village.</p>
<p>Reader of superior rank, if the passions which rage in the
bosom of the inferior class of human kind are beneath your
sympathy, throw aside this little history, for Rebecca Rymer and
Agnes Primrose are its heroines.</p>
<p>But you, unprejudiced reader, whose liberal observations are
not confined to stations, but who consider all mankind alike
deserving your investigation; who believe that there exists, in
some, knowledge without the advantage of instruction; refinement
of sentiment independent of elegant society; honourable pride of
heart without dignity of blood; and genius destitute of art to
render it conspicuous&mdash;you will, perhaps, venture to read
on, in hopes that the remainder of this story may deserve your
attention, just as the wild herb of the forest, equally with the
cultivated plant in the garden, claims the attention of the
botanist.</p>
<p>Young William saw in young Agnes even more beauty than was
beheld by others; and on those days when he felt no inclination
to ride, to shoot, or to hunt, he would contrive, by some secret
device, the means to meet with her alone, and give her tokens (if
not of his love) at least of his admiration of her beauty, and of
the pleasure he enjoyed in her company.</p>
<p>Agnes listened, with a kind of delirious enchantment, to all
her elevated and eloquent admirer uttered; and in return for his
praises of her charms, and his equivocal replies in respect to
his designs towards her, she gave to him her most undisguised
thoughts, and her whole enraptured heart.</p>
<p>This harmless intercourse (as she believed it) had not lasted
many weeks before she loved him: she even confessed she did,
every time that any unwonted mark of attention from him struck
with unexpected force her infatuated senses.</p>
<p>It has been said by a celebrated writer, upon the affection
subsisting between the two sexes, &ldquo;that there are many
persons who, if they had never heard of the passion of love,
would never have felt it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Might it not with equal
truth be added, that there are many more, who, having heard of
it, and believing most firmly that they feel it, are nevertheless
mistaken?&nbsp; Neither of these cases was the lot of
Agnes.&nbsp; She experienced the sentiment before she ever heard
it named in the sense with which it had possessed
her&mdash;joined with numerous other sentiments; for genuine
love, however rated as the chief passion of the human heart, is
but a poor dependent, a retainer upon other passions; admiration,
gratitude, respect, esteem, pride in the object.&nbsp; Divest the
boasted sensation of these, and it is not more than the
impression of a twelve-month, by courtesy, or vulgar error,
termed love.</p>
<p>Agnes was formed by the rarest structure of the human frame,
and destined by the tenderest thrillings of the human soul, to
inspire and to experience real love: but her nice taste, her
delicate thoughts, were so refined beyond the sphere of her own
station in society, that nature would have produced this prodigy
of attraction in vain, had not one of superior education and
manners assailed her affections; and had she been accustomed to
the conversation of men in William&rsquo;s rank of life, she had,
perhaps, treated William&rsquo;s addresses with indifference;
but, in comparing him with her familiar acquaintance, he was a
miracle!&nbsp; His unremitting attention seemed the condescension
of an elevated being, to whom she looked up with reverence, with
admiration, with awe, with pride, with sense of
obligation&mdash;and all those various passions which constitute
true, and never-to-be-eradicated, love.</p>
<p>But in vain she felt and even avowed with her lips what every
look, every gesture, had long denoted; William, with discontent,
sometimes with anger, upbraided her for her false professions,
and vowed, &ldquo;that while one tender proof, which he fervently
besought, was wanting, she did but aggravate his misery by less
endearments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agnes had been taught the full estimation of female virtue;
and if her nature could have detested any one creature in a state
of wretchedness, it would have been the woman who had lost her
honour; yet, for William, what would not Agnes forfeit?&nbsp; The
dignity, the peace, the serenity, the innocence of her own mind,
love soon encouraged her to fancy she could easily forego; and
this same overpowering influence at times so forcibly possessed
her, that she even felt a momentary transport in the
contemplation &ldquo;of so precious a sacrifice to
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; But then she loved her parents, and their
happiness she could not prevail with herself to barter even for
<i>his</i>.&nbsp; She wished he would demand some other pledge of
her attachment to him; for there was none but this, her ruin in
no other shape, that she would deny at his request.&nbsp; While
thus she deliberated, she prepared for her fall.</p>
<p>Bred up with strict observance both of his moral and religious
character, William did not dare to tell an unequivocal lie even
to his inferiors; he never promised Agnes he would marry her;
nay, even he paid so much respect to the forms of truth, that no
sooner was it evident that he had obtained her heart, her whole
soul entire&mdash;so that loss of innocence would be less
terrifying than separation from him&mdash;no sooner did he
perceive this, than he candidly told her he &ldquo;could never
make her his wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the same time he lamented
&ldquo;the difference of their births, and the duty he owed his
parents&rsquo; hopes,&rdquo; in terms so pathetic to her partial
ear, that she thought him a greater object of compassion in his
attachment even than herself; and was now urged by pity to remove
the cause of his complainings.</p>
<p>One evening Henry accidentally passed the lonely spot where
William and she constantly met; he observed his cousin&rsquo;s
impassioned eye, and her affectionate yet fearful glance.&nbsp;
William, he saw, took delight in the agitation of mind, in the
strong apprehension mixed with the love of Agnes.&nbsp; This
convinced Henry that either he or himself was not in love; for
his heart told him he would not have beheld such emotions of
tenderness, mingled with such marks of sorrow, upon the
countenance of Rebecca, for the wealth of the universe.</p>
<p>The first time he was alone with William after this, he
mentioned his observation on Agnes&rsquo;s apparent affliction,
and asked &ldquo;why her grief was the result of their stolen
meetings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Williams, &ldquo;her
professions are unlimited, while her manners are reserved; and I
accuse her of loving me with unkind moderation, while I love her
to distraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You design to marry her, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you degrade me by the supposition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it degrade you more to marry her than to make her
your companion?&nbsp; To talk with her for hours in preference to
all other company?&nbsp; To wish to be endeared to her by still
closer ties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this is not raising her to the rank of my
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is still raising her to that rank for which wives
alone were allotted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk wildly!&nbsp; I tell you I love her; but not
enough, I hope, to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But too much, I hope, to undo her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be her own free choice&mdash;I make use of no
unwarrantable methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the warrantable ones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, I have made her no false promises; offered no
pretended settlement; vowed no eternal constancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have told her you love her; and, from that
confession, has she not reason to expect every protection which
even promises could secure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot answer for her expectations; but I know if she
should make me as happy as I ask, and I should then forsake her,
I shall not break my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still she will be deceived, for you will falsify your
looks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she depends on my looks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read in some book, <i>Looks are the
lover&rsquo;s sole dependence</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no objection to her interpreting mine in her
favour; but then for the consequences she will have herself, and
only herself, to blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Heaven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you exclaim so vehemently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A forcible idea of the bitterness of that calamity
which inflicts self-reproach!&nbsp; Oh, rather deceive her; leave
her the consolation to reproach <i>you</i> rather than
<i>herself</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My honour will not suffer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exert your honour, and never see her more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot live without her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then live with her by the laws of your country, and
make her and yourself both happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to make my father and my mother miserable?&nbsp;
They would disown me for such a step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother, perhaps, might be offended, but your
father could not.&nbsp; Remember the sermon he preached but last
Sunday, upon&mdash;<i>the shortness of this
life</i>&mdash;<i>contempt of all riches and worldly honours in
balance with a quiet conscience</i>; and the assurance he gave
us, <i>that the greatest happiness enjoyed upon earth was to be
found under a humble roof</i>, <i>with heaven in
prospect</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is a very good man,&rdquo; said William;
&ldquo;and yet, instead of being satisfied with a humble roof, he
looks impatiently forward to a bishop&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so very good, then,&rdquo; said Henry,
&ldquo;that perhaps, seeing the dangers to which men in exalted
stations are exposed, he has such extreme philanthropy, and so
little self-love, he would rather that <i>himself</i> should
brave those perils incidental to wealth and grandeur than any
other person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not yet civilised,&rdquo; said William;
&ldquo;and to argue with you is but to instruct, without gaining
instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, sir,&rdquo; replied Henry, &ldquo;that you are
studying the law most assiduously, and indulge flattering hopes
of rising to eminence in your profession: but let me hint to
you&mdash;that though you may be perfect in the knowledge how to
administer the commandments of men, unless you keep in view the
precepts of God, your judgment, like mine, will be
fallible.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p>The dean&rsquo;s family passed this first summer at the
new-purchased estate so pleasantly, that they left it with regret
when winter called them to their house in town.</p>
<p>But if some felt concern in quitting the village of Anfield,
others who were left behind felt the deepest anguish.&nbsp; Those
were not the poor&mdash;for rigid attention to the religion and
morals of people in poverty, and total neglect of their bodily
wants, was the dean&rsquo;s practice.&nbsp; He forced them to
attend church every Sabbath; but whether they had a dinner on
their return was too gross and temporal an inquiry for his
spiritual fervour.&nbsp; Good of the soul was all he aimed at;
and this pious undertaking, besides his diligence as a pastor,
required all his exertion as a magistrate&mdash;for to be very
poor and very honest, very oppressed yet very thankful, is a
degree of sainted excellence not often to be attained, without
the aid of zealous men to frighten into virtue.</p>
<p>Those, then, who alone felt sorrow at the dean&rsquo;s
departure were two young women, whose parents, exempt from
indigence, preserved them from suffering under his unpitying
piety, but whose discretion had not protected them from the
bewitching smiles of his nephew, and the seducing wiles of his
son.</p>
<p>The first morning that Rebecca rose and knew Henry was gone
till the following summer, she wished she could have laid down
again and slept away the whole long interval.&nbsp; Her
sisters&rsquo; peevishness, her father&rsquo;s austerity, she
foresaw, would be insupportable now that she had experienced
Henry&rsquo;s kindness, and he was no longer near to fortify her
patience.&nbsp; She sighed&mdash;she wept&mdash;she was
unhappy.</p>
<p>But if Rebecca awoke with a dejected mind and an aching heart,
what were the sorrows of Agnes?&nbsp; The only child of doating
parents, she never had been taught the necessity of
resignation&mdash;untutored, unread, unused to reflect, but
knowing how to feel; what were her sufferings when, on waking,
she called to mind that &ldquo;William was gone,&rdquo; and with
him gone all that excess of happiness which his presence had
bestowed, and for which she had exchanged her future
tranquillity?</p>
<p>Loss of tranquillity even Rebecca had to bemoan: Agnes had
still more&mdash;the loss of innocence!</p>
<p>Hal William remained in the village, shame, even conscience,
perhaps, might have been silenced; but, separated from her
betrayer, parted from the joys of guilt, and left only to its
sorrows, every sting which quick sensibility could sharpen, to
torture her, was transfixed in her heart.&nbsp; First came the
recollection of a cold farewell from the man whose love she had
hoped her yielding passion had for ever won; next, flashed on her
thoughts her violated person; next, the crime incurred; then her
cruelty to her parents; and, last of all, the horrors of
detection.</p>
<p>She knew that as yet, by wariness, care, and contrivance, her
meetings with William had been unsuspected; but, in this agony of
mind, her fears fore-boded an informer who would defy all
caution; who would stigmatise her with a name&mdash;dear and
desired by every virtuous female&mdash;abhorrent to the blushing
harlot&mdash;the name of mother.</p>
<p>That Agnes, thus impressed, could rise from her bed, meet her
parents and her neighbours with her usual smile of vivacity, and
voice of mirth, was impossible: to leave her bed at all, to creep
downstairs, and reply in a faint, broken voice to questions
asked, were, in her state of mind, mighty efforts; and they were
all to which her struggles could attain for many weeks.</p>
<p>William had promised to write to her while he was away: he
kept his word; but not till the end of two months did she receive
a letter.&nbsp; Fear for his health, apprehension of his death
during this cruel interim, caused an agony of suspense, which, by
representing him to her distracted fancy in a state of suffering,
made him, if possible, still dearer to her.&nbsp; In the
excruciating anguish of uncertainty, she walked with trembling
steps through all weathers (when she could steal half a day while
her parents were employed in labour abroad) to the post town, at
six miles&rsquo; distance, to inquire for his long-expected,
long-wished-for letter.</p>
<p>When at last it was given to her, that moment of consolation
seemed to repay her for the whole time of agonising terror she
had endured.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is alive!&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I have suffered nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hastily put this token of his health and his remembrance
of her into her bosom, rich as an empress with a new-acquired
dominion.&nbsp; The way from home, which she had trod with heavy
pace, in the fear of renewed disappointment, she skimmed along on
her return swift as a doe: the cold did not pierce, neither did
the rain wet her.&nbsp; Many a time she put her hand upon the
prize she possessed, to find if it were safe: once, on the road,
she took it from her bosom, curiously viewed the seal and the
direction, then replacing it, did not move her fingers from their
fast grip till she arrived at her own house.</p>
<p>Her father and her mother were still absent.&nbsp; She drew a
chair, and placing it near to the only window in the room, seated
herself with ceremonious order; then gently drew forth her
treasure, laid it on her knee, and with a smile that almost
amounted to a laugh of gladness, once more inspected the outward
part, before she would trust herself with the excessive joy of
looking within.</p>
<p>At length the seal was broken&mdash;but the contents still a
secret.&nbsp; Poor Agnes had learned to write as some youths
learn Latin: so short a time had been allowed for the
acquirement, and so little expert had been her master, that it
took her generally a week to write a letter of ten lines, and a
month to read one of twenty.&nbsp; But this being a letter on
which her mind was deeply engaged, her whole imagination aided
her slender literature, and at the end of a fortnight she had
made out every word.&nbsp; They were these&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;D<sup>r</sup>. Agnes,&mdash;I hope you have
been well since we parted&mdash;I have been very well myself; but
I have been teased with a great deal of business, which has not
given me time to write to you before.&nbsp; I have been called to
the bar, which engages every spare moment; but I hope it will not
prevent my coming down to Anfield with my father in the
summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I am, D<sup>r</sup>.
Agnes,<br />
&ldquo;With gratitude for all the favours you<br />
have conferred on me,<br />
&ldquo;Yours, &amp;c.<br />
&ldquo;W. N.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To have beheld the illiterate Agnes trying for two weeks, day
and night, to find out the exact words of this letter, would have
struck the spectator with amazement, had he also understood the
right, the delicate, the nicely proper sensations with which she
was affected by every sentence it contained.</p>
<p>She wished it had been kinder, even for his sake who wrote it;
because she thought so well of him, and desired still to think so
well, that she was sorry at any faults which rendered him less
worthy of her good opinion.&nbsp; The cold civility of his letter
had this effect&mdash;her clear, her acute judgment felt it a
kind of prevarication to <i>promise to write and then write
nothing that was hoped for</i>.&nbsp; But, enthralled by the
magic of her passion, she shortly found excuses for the man she
loved, at the expense of her own condemnation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has only the fault of inconstancy,&rdquo; she cried;
&ldquo;and that has been caused by <i>my</i> change of
conduct.&nbsp; Had I been virtuous still, he had still been
affectionate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bitter reflection!</p>
<p>Yet there was a sentence in the letter, that, worse than all
the tenderness left out, wounded her sensibility; and she could
not read the line, <i>gratitude for all the favours conferred on
me</i>, without turning pale with horror, then kindling with
indignation at the commonplace thanks, which insultingly reminded
her of her innocence given in exchange for unmeaning
acknowledgments.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p>Absence is said to increase strong and virtuous love, but to
destroy that which is weak and sensual.&nbsp; In the parallel
between young William and young Henry, this was the case; for
Henry&rsquo;s real love increased, while William&rsquo;s
turbulent passion declined in separation: yet had the latter not
so much abated that he did not perceive a sensation, like a
sudden shock of sorrow, on a proposal made him by his father, of
entering the marriage state with a young woman, the dependent
niece of Lady Bendham; who, as the dean informed him, had
signified her lord&rsquo;s and her own approbation of his
becoming their nephew.</p>
<p>At the first moment William received this intimation from his
father, his heart revolted with disgust from the object, and he
instantly thought upon Agnes with more affection than he had done
for many weeks before.&nbsp; This was from the comparison between
her and his proposed wife; for he had frequently seen Miss
Sedgeley at Lord Bendham&rsquo;s, but had never seen in her whole
person or manners the least attraction to excite his love.&nbsp;
He pictured to himself an unpleasant home, with a companion so
little suited to his taste, and felt a pang of conscience, as
well as of attachment, in the thought of giving up for ever his
poor Agnes.</p>
<p>But these reflections, these feelings, lasted only for the
moment.&nbsp; No sooner had the dean explained why the marriage
was desirable, recited what great connections and what great
patronage it would confer upon their family, than William
listened with eagerness, and both his love and his conscience
were, if not wholly quieted, at least for the present hushed.</p>
<p>Immediately after the dean had expressed to Lord and Lady
Bendham his son&rsquo;s &ldquo;sense of the honour and the
happiness conferred on him, by their condescension in admitting
him a member of their noble family,&rdquo; Miss Sedgeley received
from her aunt nearly the same shock as William had done from his
father.&nbsp; <i>For she</i> (placed in the exact circumstance of
her intended husband) <i>had frequently seen the dean&rsquo;s son
at Lord Bendham&rsquo;s</i>, <i>but had never see in his whole
person or manners the least attraction to excite her
love</i>.&nbsp; <i>She pictured to herself an unpleasant
home</i>, <i>with a companion so little suited to her taste</i>;
and at this moment she felt a more than usual partiality to the
dean&rsquo;s nephew, finding the secret hope she had long
indulged of winning his affections so near being thwarted.</p>
<p>But Miss Sedgeley was too much subjected to the power of her
uncle and aunt to have a will of her own, at least, to dare to
utter it.&nbsp; She received the commands of Lady Bendham with
her accustomed submission, while all the consolation for the
grief they gave her was, &ldquo;that she resolved to make a very
bad wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not care a pin for my husband,&rdquo; said she
to herself; &ldquo;and so I will dress and visit, and do just as
I like; he dare not be unkind because of my aunt.&nbsp; Besides,
now I think again, it is not so disagreeable to marry <i>him</i>
as if I were obliged to marry into any other family, because I
shall see his cousin Henry as often, if not oftener than
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Miss Sedgeley&mdash;whose person he did not like, and with
her mind thus disposed&mdash;William began to force himself to
shake off every little remaining affection, even all pity, for
the unfortunate, the beautiful, the sensible, the doating Agnes;
and determined to place in a situation to look down with scorn
upon her sorrows, this weak, this unprincipled woman.</p>
<p>Connections, interest, honours, were powerful advocates.&nbsp;
His private happiness William deemed trivial compared to public
opinion; and to be under obligations to a peer, his wife&rsquo;s
relation, gave greater renown in his servile mind than all the
advantages which might accrue from his own intrinsic independent
worth.</p>
<p>In the usual routine of pretended regard and real
indifference&mdash;sometimes disgust&mdash;between parties allied
by what is falsely termed <i>prudence</i>, the intended union of
Mr. Norwynne with Miss Sedgeley proceeded in all due form; and at
their country seats at Anfield, during the summer, their nuptials
were appointed to be celebrated.</p>
<p>William was now introduced into all Lord Bendham&rsquo;s
courtly circles.&nbsp; His worldly soul was entranced in glare
and show; he thought of nothing but places, pensions, titles,
retinues; and steadfast, alert, unshaken in the pursuit of
honours, neglected not the lesser means of rising to
preferment&mdash;his own endowments.&nbsp; But in this round of
attention to pleasures and to study, he no more complained to
Agnes of &ldquo;excess of business.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cruel as she had
once thought that letter in which he thus apologised for
slighting her, she at last began to think it was wondrous kind,
for he never found time to send her another.&nbsp; Yet she had
studied with all her most anxious care to write him an answer;
such a one as might not lessen her understanding, which he had
often praised, in his esteem.</p>
<p>Ah, William! even with less anxiety your beating, ambitious
heart panted for the admiration of an attentive auditory, when
you first ventured to harangue in public!&nbsp; With far less
hope and fear (great as yours were) did you first address a
crowded court, and thirst for its approbation on your efforts,
than Agnes sighed for your approbation when she took a pen and
awkwardly scrawled over a sheet of paper.&nbsp; Near twenty times
she began, but to a gentleman&mdash;and one she loved like
William&mdash;what could she dare to say?&nbsp; Yet she had
enough to tell, if shame had not interposed, or if remaining
confidence in his affection had but encouraged her.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by the first, and deprived of the last, her hand
shook, her head drooped, and she dared not communicate what she
knew must inevitably render her letter unpleasing, and still more
depreciate her in his regard, as the occasion of encumbrance, and
of injury to his moral reputation.</p>
<p>Her free, her liberal, her venturous spirit subdued,
intimidated by the force of affection, she only wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am
sorry you have so much to do, and should be ashamed if you put it
off to write to me.&nbsp; I have not been at all well this
winter.&nbsp; I never before passed such a one in all my life,
and I hope you will never know such a one yourself in regard to
not being happy.&nbsp; I should be sorry if you did&mdash;think I
would rather go through it again myself than you should.&nbsp; I
long for the summer, the fields are so green, and everything so
pleasant at that time of the year.&nbsp; I always do long for the
summer, but I think never so much in my life as for this that is
coming; though sometimes I wish that last summer had never
come.&nbsp; Perhaps you wish so too; and that this summer would
not come either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you will excuse all faults, as I never learnt but
one month.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your obedient humble
servant,<br />
&ldquo;A. P.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p>Summer arrived, and lords and ladies, who had partaken of all
the dissipation of the town, whom opera-houses, gaming-houses,
and various other houses had detained whole nights from their
peaceful home, were now poured forth from the metropolis, to
imbibe the wholesome air of the farmer and peasant, and
disseminate, in return, moral and religious principles.</p>
<p>Among the rest, Lord and Lady Bendham, strenuous opposers of
vice in the poor, and gentle supporters of it in the rich, never
played at cards, or had concerts on a Sunday, in the village,
where the poor were spies&mdash;<i>he</i>, there, never gamed,
nor drank, except in private, and <i>she</i> banished from her
doors every woman of sullied character.&nbsp; Yet poverty and
idiotism are not the same.&nbsp; The poor can hear, can talk,
sometimes can reflect; servants will tell their equals how they
live in town; listeners will smile and shake their heads; and
thus hypocrisy, instead of cultivating, destroys every seed of
moral virtue.</p>
<p>The arrival of Lord Bendham&rsquo;s family at Anfield
announced to the village that the dean&rsquo;s would quickly
follow.&nbsp; Rebecca&rsquo;s heart bounded with joy at the
prospect.&nbsp; Poor Agnes felt a sinking, a foreboding tremor,
that wholly interrupted the joy of <i>her</i> expectations.&nbsp;
She had not heard from William for five tedious months.&nbsp; She
did not know whether he loved or despised, whether he thought of
or had forgotten her.&nbsp; Her reason argued against the hope
that he loved her; yet hope still subsisted.&nbsp; She would not
abandon herself to despair while there was doubt.&nbsp; She
&ldquo;had frequently been deceived by the appearance of
circumstances; and perhaps he might come all
kindness&mdash;perhaps, even not like her the less for that
indisposition which had changed her bloom to paleness, and the
sparkling of her eyes to a pensive languor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s sensations, on his return to Anfield, were the
self-same as Rebecca&rsquo;s were; sympathy in thought, sympathy
in affection, sympathy in virtue made them so.&nbsp; As he
approached near the little village, he felt more light than
usual.&nbsp; He had committed no trespass there, dreaded no
person&rsquo;s reproach or inquiries; but his arrival might
prove, at least to one object, the cause of rejoicing.</p>
<p>William&rsquo;s sensations were the reverse of these.&nbsp; In
spite of his ambition, and the flattering view of one day
accomplishing all to which it aspired, he often, as they
proceeded on their journey, envied the gaiety of Henry, and felt
an inward monitor that told him &ldquo;he must first act like
Henry, to be as happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His intended marriage was still, to the families of both
parties (except to the heads of the houses), a profound
secret.&nbsp; Neither the servants, nor even Henry, had received
the slightest intimation of the designed alliance; and this to
William was matter of some comfort.</p>
<p>When men submit to act in contradiction to their principles,
nothing is so precious as a secret.&nbsp; In their estimation, to
have their conduct <i>known</i> is the essential mischief.&nbsp;
While it is hid, they fancy the sin but half committed; and to
the moiety of a crime they reconcile their feelings, till, in
progression, the whole, when disclosed, appears trivial.&nbsp; He
designed that Agnes should receive the news from himself by
degrees, and in such a manner as to console her, or at least to
silence her complaints; and with the wish to soften the regret
which he still felt on the prudent necessity of yielding her
wholly up when his marriage should take place, he promised to
himself some intervening hours of private meetings, which he
hoped would produce satiety.</p>
<p>While Henry flew to Mr. Rymer&rsquo;s house with a conscience
clear, and a face enlightened with gladness&mdash;while he met
Rebecca with open-hearted friendship and frankness, which charmed
her soul to peaceful happiness&mdash;William skulked around the
cottage of Agnes, dreading detection; and when, towards midnight,
he found the means to obtain the company of the sad inhabitant,
he grew so impatient at her tears and sobs, at the delicacy with
which she withheld her caresses, that he burst into bitter
upbraidings at her coyness, and at length (without discovering
the cause of her peculiar agitation and reserve) abruptly left
her vowing &ldquo;never to see her more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he turned away, his heart even congratulated him
&ldquo;that he had made so discreet a use of his momentary
disappointment, as thus to shake her off at once without further
explanation or excuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, ignorant and illiterate as she was, knew enough of her
own heart to judge of his, and to know that such violent
affections and expressions, above all, such a sudden,
heart-breaking manner of departure, were not the effects of love,
nor even of humanity.&nbsp; She felt herself debased by a
ruffian&mdash;yet still, having loved him when she thought him a
far different character, the blackest proof of the deception
could not cause a sentiment formed whilst she was deceived.</p>
<p>She passed the remainder of the night in anguish: but with the
cheerful morning some cheery thoughts consoled her.&nbsp; She
thought &ldquo;perhaps William by this time had found himself to
blame; had conceived the cause of her grief and her distant
behaviour, and had pitied her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next evening she waited, with anxious heart, for the
signal that had called her out the foregoing night.&nbsp; In vain
she watched, counted the hours, and the stars, and listened to
the nightly stillness of the fields around: they were not
disturbed by the tread of her lover.&nbsp; Daylight came; the sun
rose in its splendour: William had not been near her, and it
shone upon none so miserable as Agnes.</p>
<p>She now considered his word, &ldquo;never to see her
more,&rdquo; as solemnly passed: she heard anew the impressive,
the implacable tone in which the sentence was pronounced; and
could look back on no late token of affection on which to found
the slightest hope that he would recall it.</p>
<p>Still, reluctant to despair&mdash;in the extremity of grief,
in the extremity of fear for an approaching crisis which must
speedily arrive, she (after a few days had elapsed) trusted a
neighbouring peasant with a letter to deliver to Mr. Norwynne in
private.</p>
<p>This letter, unlike the last, was dictated without the hope to
please: no pains were taken with the style, no care in the
formation of the letters: the words flowed from necessity; strong
necessity guided her hand.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg
your pardon&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t forsake me all at
once&mdash;see me one time more&mdash;I have something to tell
you&mdash;it is what I dare tell nobody else&mdash;and what I am
ashamed to tell you&mdash;yet pray give me a word of
advice&mdash;what to do I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I then will
part, if you please, never to trouble you, never any
more&mdash;but hope to part friends&mdash;pray do, if you
please&mdash;and see me one time more.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your obedient,<br />
&ldquo;A. P.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These incorrect, inelegant lines produced this immediate
reply</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;TO AGNES
PRIMROSE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often told you, that my honour is as dear to me
as my life: my word is a part of that honour&mdash;you heard me
say <i>I would never see you again</i>.&nbsp; I shall keep my
word.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p>When the dean&rsquo;s family had been at Anfield about a
month&mdash;one misty morning, such as portends a sultry day, as
Henry was walking swiftly through a thick wood, on the skirts of
the parish, he suddenly started on hearing a distant groan,
expressive, as he thought, both of bodily and mental pain.&nbsp;
He stopped to hear it repeated, that he might pursue the
sound.&nbsp; He heard it again; and though now but in murmurs,
yet, as the tone implied excessive grief, he directed his course
to that part of the wood from which it came.</p>
<p>As he advanced, in spite of the thick fog, he discerned the
appearance of a female stealing away on his approach.&nbsp; His
eye was fixed on this object; and regardless where he placed his
feet, he soon shrunk back with horror, on perceiving they had
nearly trod upon a new-born infant, lying on the ground!&mdash;a
lovely male child, entered on a world where not one preparation
had been made to receive him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Henry, forgetting the person who had
fled, and with a smile of compassion on the helpless infant,
&ldquo;I am glad I have found you&mdash;you give more joy to me
than you have done to your hapless parents.&nbsp; Poor
dear,&rdquo; continued he, while he took off his coat to wrap it
in, &ldquo;I will take care of you while I live&mdash;I will beg
for you, rather than you shall want; but first, I will carry you
to those who can, at present, do more for you than
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Henry said and thought, while he enclosed the child
carefully in his coat, and took it in his arms.&nbsp; But
proceeding to walk his way with it, an unlucky query struck him,
<i>where he should go</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not take it to the dean&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;because Lady Clementina will suspect it is not
nobly, and my uncle will suspect it is not lawfully, born.&nbsp;
Nor must I take it to Lord Bendham&rsquo;s for the self-same
reason, though, could it call Lady Bendham mother, this whole
village, nay, the whole country round, would ring with rejoicings
for its birth.&nbsp; How strange!&rdquo; continued he,
&ldquo;that we should make so little of human creatures, that one
sent among us, wholly independent of his own high value, becomes
a curse instead of a blessing by the mere accident of
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now, after walking out of the wood, peeped through the
folds of his coat to look again at his charge.&nbsp; He started,
turned pale, and trembled to behold what, in the surprise of
first seeing the child, had escaped his observation.&nbsp; Around
its little throat was a cord entwined by a slipping noose, and
drawn half way&mdash;as if the trembling hand of the murderer had
revolted from its dreadful office, and he or she had heft the
infant to pine away in nakedness and hunger, rather than see it
die.</p>
<p>Again Henry wished himself joy of the treasure he had found;
and more fervently than before; for he had not only preserved one
fellow-creature from death, but another from murder.</p>
<p>Once more he looked at his charge, and was transported to
observe, upon its serene brow and sleepy eye, no traces of the
dangers it had passed&mdash;no trait of shame either for itself
or its parents&mdash;no discomposure at the unwelcome reception
it was likely to encounter from a proud world!&nbsp; He now
slipped the fatal string from its neck; and by this affectionate
disturbance causing the child to cry, he ran (but he scarcely
knew whither) to convey it to a better nurse.</p>
<p>He at length found himself at the door of his dear
Rebecca&mdash;for so very happy Henry felt at the good luck which
had befallen him, that he longed to bestow a part of the blessing
upon her he loved.</p>
<p>He sent for her privately out of the house to speak to
him.&nbsp; When she came, &ldquo;Rebecca,&rdquo; said he (looking
around that no one observed him), &ldquo;Rebecca, I have brought
you something you will like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Rebecca, that you love deserted birds,
strayed kittens, and motherless lambs.&nbsp; I have brought
something more pitiable than any of these.&nbsp; Go, get a cap
and a little gown, and then I will give it you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gown!&rdquo; exclaimed Rebecca.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
have brought me a monkey, much as I should esteem any present
from <i>you</i>, indeed I cannot touch it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A monkey!&rdquo; repeated Henry, almost in anger: then
changing the tone of his voice, exclaimed in triumph,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this he gave it a gentle pinch, that its cry might confirm
the pleasing truth he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child!&rdquo; repeated Rebecca in amaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and indeed I found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I did.&nbsp; The mother, I fear, had just
forsaken it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inhuman creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, hold, Rebecca!&nbsp; I am sure you will pity her
when you see her child&mdash;you then will know she must have
loved it&mdash;and you will consider how much she certainly had
suffered before she left it to perish in a wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cruel!&rdquo; once more exclaimed Rebecca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Rebecca, perhaps, had she possessed a home of
her own she would have given it the best place in it; had she
possessed money, she would have dressed it with the nicest care;
or had she been accustomed to disgrace, she would have gloried in
calling it hers!&nbsp; But now, as it is, it is sent to
us&mdash;to you and me, Rebecca&mdash;to take care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca, soothed by Henry&rsquo;s compassionate eloquence,
held out her arms and received the important parcel; and, as she
kindly looked in upon the little stranger,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, are not you much obliged to me,&rdquo; said Henry,
&ldquo;for having brought it to you?&nbsp; I know no one but
yourself to whom I would have trusted it with
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged to you,&rdquo; repeated Rebecca, with a
very serious face, &ldquo;if I did but know what to do with
it&mdash;where to put it&mdash;where to hide it from my father
and sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! anywhere,&rdquo; returned Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
very good&mdash;it will not cry.&nbsp; Besides, in one of the
distant, unfrequented rooms of your old abbey, through the thick
walls and long gallery, an infant&rsquo;s cry cannot pass.&nbsp;
Yet, pray be cautious how you conceal it; for if it should be
discovered by your father or sisters, they will take it from you,
prosecute the wretched mother, and send the child to the
parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do all I can to prevent them,&rdquo; said
Rebecca; &ldquo;and I think I call to mind a part of the house
where it <i>must</i> be safe.&nbsp; I know, too, I can take milk
from the dairy, and bread from the pantry, without their being
missed, or my father much the poorer.&nbsp; But
if&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; That instant they were interrupted by the
appearance of the stern curate at a little distance.&nbsp; Henry
was obliged to run swiftly away, while Rebecca returned by
stealth into the house with her innocent burthen.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p>There is a word in the vocabulary more bitter, more direful in
its import, than all the rest.&nbsp; Reader, if poverty, if
disgrace, if bodily pain, even if slighted love be your unhappy
fate, kneel and bless Heaven for its beneficent influence, so
that you are not tortured with the anguish
of&mdash;<i>remorse</i>.</p>
<p>Deep contrition for past offences had long been the punishment
of unhappy Agnes; but, till the day she brought her child into
the world, <i>remorse</i> had been averted.&nbsp; From that day,
life became an insupportable load, for all reflection was
torture!&nbsp; To think, merely to think, was to suffer
excruciating agony; yet, never before was <i>thought</i> so
intrusive&mdash;it haunted her in every spot, in all discourse or
company: sleep was no shelter&mdash;she never slept but her
racking dreams told her&mdash;&ldquo;she had slain her
infant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They presented to her view the naked innocent whom she had
longed to press to her bosom, while she lifted up her hand
against its life.&nbsp; They laid before her the piteous babe
whom her eyeballs strained to behold once more, while her feet
hurried her away for ever.</p>
<p>Often had Agnes, by the winter&rsquo;s fire, listened to tales
of ghosts&mdash;of the unceasing sting of a guilty conscience;
often had she shuddered at the recital of murders; often had she
wept over the story of the innocent put to death, and stood
aghast that the human mind could premeditate the heinous crime of
assassination.</p>
<p>From the tenderest passion the most savage impulse may arise:
in the deep recesses of fondness, sometimes is implanted the root
of cruelty; and from loving William with unbounded lawless
affection, she found herself depraved so as to become the very
object which could most of all excite her own horror!</p>
<p>Still, at delirious intervals, that passion, which, like a
fatal talisman, had enchanted her whole soul, held out the
delusive prospect that &ldquo;William might yet relent;&rdquo;
for, though she had for ever discarded the hope of peace, she
could not force herself to think but that, again blest with his
society, she should, at least for the time that he was present
with her, taste the sweet cup of &ldquo;forgetfulness of the
past,&rdquo; for which she so ardently thirsted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should he return to me,&rdquo; she thought in those
paroxysms of delusion, &ldquo;I would to <i>him</i> unbosom all
my guilt; and as a remote, a kind of unwary accomplice in my
crime, his sense, his arguments, ever ready in making light of my
sins, might afford a respite to my troubled
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While thus she unwittingly thought, and sometimes watched
through the night, starting with convulsed rapture at every
sound, because it might possibly be the harbinger of him,
<i>he</i> was busied in carefully looking over marriage articles,
fixing the place of residence with his destined bride, or making
love to her in formal process.&nbsp; Yet, Agnes, vaunt!&mdash;he
sometimes thought on thee&mdash;he could not witness the folly,
the weakness, the vanity, the selfishness of his future wife,
without frequently comparing her with thee.&nbsp; When equivocal
words and prevaricating sentences fell from her lips, he
remembered with a sigh thy candour&mdash;that open sincerity
which dwelt upon thy tongue, and seemed to vie with thy
undisguised features, to charm the listener even beyond the
spectator.&nbsp; While Miss Sedgeley eagerly grasped at all the
gifts he offered, he could not but call to mind &ldquo;that
Agnes&rsquo;s declining hand was always closed, and her looks
forbidding, every time he proffered such disrespectful tokens of
his love.&rdquo;&nbsp; He recollected the softness which beamed
from her eyes, the blush on her face at his approach, while he
could never discern one glance of tenderness from the niece of
Lord Bendham: and the artificial bloom on her cheeks was nearly
as disgusting as the ill-conducted artifice with which she
attempted gentleness and love.</p>
<p>But all these impediments were only observed as trials of his
fortitude&mdash;his prudence could overcome his aversion, and
thus he valued himself upon his manly firmness.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas now, that William being rid, by the peevishness of
Agnes, most honourably of all future ties to her, and the day of
his marriage with Miss Sedgeley being fixed, that Henry, with the
rest of the house, learnt what to them was news.&nbsp; The first
dart of Henry&rsquo;s eye upon his cousin, when, in his presence,
he was told of the intended union, caused a reddening on the face
of the latter: he always fancied Henry saw his thoughts; and he
knew that Henry in return would give him <i>his</i>.&nbsp; On the
present occasion, no sooner were they alone, and Henry began to
utter them, than William charged him&mdash;&ldquo;Not to dare to
proceed; for that, too long accustomed to trifle, the time was
come when serious matters could alone employ his time; and when
men of approved sense must take place of friends and confidants
like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry replied, &ldquo;The love, the sincerity of friends, I
thought, were their best qualities: these I possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you do not possess knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that be knowledge which has of late estranged you
from all who bear you a sincere affection; which imprints every
day more and more upon your features the marks of gloomy
inquietude; am I not happier in my ignorance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not torment me with your ineffectual
reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called at the cottage of poor Agnes the other
day,&rdquo; returned Henry: &ldquo;her father and mother were
taking their homely meal alone; and when I asked for their
daughter, they wept and said&mdash;Agnes was not the girl she had
been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William cast his eyes on the floor.</p>
<p>Henry proceeded&mdash;&ldquo;They said a sickness, which they
feared would bring her to the grave, had preyed upon her for some
time past.&nbsp; They had procured a doctor: but no remedy was
found, and they feared the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What worst!&rdquo; cried William (now recovered from
the effect of the sudden intelligence, and attempting a
smile).&nbsp; &ldquo;Do they think she will die?&nbsp; And do you
think it will be for love?&nbsp; We do not hear of these deaths
often, Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if <i>she</i> die, who will hear of
<i>that</i>?&nbsp; No one but those interested to conceal the
cause: and thus it is, that dying for love becomes a
phenomenon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry would have pursued the discourse farther; but William,
impatient on all disputes, except where his argument was the
better one, retired from the controversy, crying out, &ldquo;I
know my duty, and want no instructor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be unjust to William to say he did not feel for this
reported illness of Agnes&mdash;he felt, during that whole
evening, and part of the next morning&mdash;but business,
pleasures, new occupations, and new schemes of future success,
crowded to dissipate all unwelcome reflections; and he trusted to
her youth, her health, her animal spirits, and, above all, to the
folly of the gossips&rsquo; story of <i>dying for love</i>, as a
surety for her life, and a safeguard for his conscience.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p>The child of William and Agnes was secreted, by Rebecca, in a
distant chamber belonging to the dreary parsonage, near to which
scarcely any part of the family ever went.&nbsp; There she
administered to all its wants, visited it every hour of the day,
and at intervals during the night viewed almost with the joy of a
mother its health, its promised life&mdash;and in a short the
found she loved her little gift better than anything on earth,
except the giver.</p>
<p>Henry called the next morning, and the next, and many
succeeding times, in hopes of an opportunity to speak alone with
Rebecca, to inquire concerning her charge, and consult when and
how he could privately relieve her from her trust; as he now
meant to procure a nurse for wages.&nbsp; In vain he called or
lurked around the house; for near five weeks all the conversation
he could obtain with her was in the company of her sisters, who,
beginning to observe his preference, his marked attention to her,
and the languid, half-smothered transport with which she received
it, indulged their envy and resentment at the contempt shown to
their charms, by watching her steps when he was away, and her
every look and whisper while he was present.</p>
<p>For five weeks, then, he was continually thwarted in his
expectation of meeting her alone: and at the end of that period
the whole design he had to accomplish by such a meeting was
rendered abortive.</p>
<p>Though Rebecca had with strictest caution locked the door of
the room in which the child was hid, and covered each crevice,
and every aperture through which sound might more easily proceed;
though she had surrounded the infant&rsquo;s head with pillows,
to obstruct all noise from his crying; yet one unlucky night, the
strength of his voice increasing with his age, he was heard by
the maid, who slept the nearest to that part of the house.</p>
<p>Not meaning to injure her young mistress, the servant next
morning simply related to the family what sounds had struck her
ear during the night, and whence they proceeded.&nbsp; At first
she was ridiculed &ldquo;for supposing herself awake when in
reality she must be dreaming.&rdquo;&nbsp; But steadfastly
persisting in what she had said, and Rebecca&rsquo;s blushes,
confusion, and eagerness to prove the maid mistaken, giving
suspicion to her charitable sisters, they watched her the very
next time she went by stealth to supply the office of a mother;
and breaking abruptly on her while feeding and caressing the
infant, they instantly concluded it was her <i>own</i>; seized
it, and, in spite of her entreaties, carried it down to their
father.</p>
<p>That account which Henry had given Rebecca &ldquo;of his
having found the child,&rdquo; and which her own sincerity,
joined to the faith she had in his word, made her receive as
truth, she now felt would be heard by the present auditors with
contempt, even with indignation, as a falsehood.&nbsp; Her
affright is easier conceived than described.</p>
<p>Accused, and forced by her sisters along with the child before
the curate, his attention to their representation, his crimson
face, knit brow, and thundering voice, struck with terror her
very soul: innocence is not always a protection against
fear&mdash;sometimes less bold than guilt.</p>
<p>In her father and sisters she saw, she knew the suspicions,
partial, cruel, boisterous natures by whom she was to be judged;
and timid, gentle, oppressed, she fell trembling on her knees,
and could only articulate,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate would not listen to this supplication till she had
replied to this question, &ldquo;Whose child is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Questioned louder, and with more violence still, &ldquo;how
the child came there, wherefore her affection for it, and whose
it was,&rdquo; she felt the improbability of the truth still more
forcibly than before, and dreaded some immediate peril from her
father&rsquo;s rage, should she dare to relate an apparent
lie.&nbsp; She paused to think upon a more probable tale than the
real one; and as she hesitated, shook in every limb&mdash;while
her father exclaimed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand the cause of this terror; it confirms your
sisters&rsquo; fears, and your own shame.&nbsp; From your infancy
I have predicted that some fatal catastrophe would befall
you.&nbsp; I never loved you like my other children&mdash;I never
had the cause: you were always unlike the rest&mdash;and I knew
your fate would be calamitous; but the very worst of my
forebodings did not come to this&mdash;so young, so guilty, and
so artful!&nbsp; Tell me this instant, are you
married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sisters lifted up their hands!</p>
<p>The father continued&mdash;&ldquo;Vile creature, I thought as
much.&nbsp; Still I will know the father of this
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cast up her eyes to Heaven, and firmly vowed she
&ldquo;did not know herself&mdash;nor who the mother
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not to be borne!&rdquo; exclaimed the curate in
fury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Persist in this, and you shall never see my
face again.&nbsp; Both your child and you I&rsquo;ll turn out of
my house instantly, unless you confess your crime, and own the
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious to know this secret, the sisters went up to Rebecca
with seeming kindness, and &ldquo;conjured her to spare her
father still greater grief, and her own and her child&rsquo;s
public infamy, by acknowledging herself its mother, and naming
the man who had undone her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emboldened by this insult from her own sex, Rebecca now began
to declare the simple truth.&nbsp; But no sooner had she said
that &ldquo;the child was presented to her care by a young man
who had found it,&rdquo; than her sisters burst into laughter,
and her father into redoubled rage.</p>
<p>Once more the women offered their advice&mdash;&ldquo;to
confess and be forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the father raved.</p>
<p>Beguiled by solicitations, and terrified by threats, like
women formerly accused of witchcraft, and other wretches put to
the torture, she thought her present sufferings worse than any
that could possibly succeed; and felt inclined to confess a
falsehood, at which her virtue shrunk, to obtain a momentary
respite from reproach; she felt inclined to take the
mother&rsquo;s share of the infant, but was at a loss to whom to
give the father&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She thought that Henry had
entailed on himself the best right to the charge; but she loved
him, and could not bear the thought of accusing him falsely.</p>
<p>While, with agitation in the extreme, she thus deliberated,
the proposition again was put,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether she would trust to the mercy of her father by
confessing, or draw down his immediate vengeance by denying her
guilt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made choice of the former&mdash;and with tears and sobs
&ldquo;owned herself the mother of the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But still&mdash;&ldquo;Who is the father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she shrunk from the question, and fervently implored
&ldquo;to be spared on that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her petition was rejected with vehemence; and the
curate&rsquo;s rage increased till she acknowledged,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry was the father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; exclaimed all her sisters at the
same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; cried the curate.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dean
shall know, before this hour is expired, the baseness of the
nephew whom he supports upon charity; he shall know the misery,
the grief, the shame he has brought on me, and how unworthy he is
of his protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! have mercy on him!&rdquo; cried Rebecca, as she
still knelt to her father: &ldquo;do not ruin him with his uncle,
for he is the best of human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, we always saw how much she loved him,&rdquo;
cried her sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wicked, unfortunate girl!&rdquo; said the clergyman
(his rage now subsiding, and tears supplying its place),
&ldquo;you have brought a scandal upon us all: your
sisters&rsquo; reputation will be stamped with the colour of
yours&mdash;my good name will suffer: but that is
trivial&mdash;your soul is lost to virtue, to religion, to
shame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>indeed</i>!&rdquo; cried Rebecca: &ldquo;if you
will but believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not I believe you?&nbsp; Have you not
confessed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not pretend to unsay what you have
said,&rdquo; cried her eldest sister: &ldquo;that would be making
things worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go out of my sight!&rdquo; said her father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take your child with you to your chamber, and never let me
see either of you again.&nbsp; I do not turn you out of my doors
to-day, because I gave you my word I would not, if you revealed
your shame; but by to-morrow I will provide some place for your
reception, where neither I, nor any of your relations, shall ever
see or hear of you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca made an effort to cling around her father, and once
more to declare her innocence: but her sisters interposed, and
she was taken, with her reputed son, to the chamber where the
curate had sentenced her to remain, till she quitted his house
for ever.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<p>The curate, in the disorder of his mind, scarcely felt the
ground he trod as he hastened to the dean&rsquo;s house to
complain of his wrongs.&nbsp; His name procured him immediate
admittance into the library, and the moment the dean appeared the
curate burst into tears.&nbsp; The cause being required of such
&ldquo;very singular marks of grief,&rdquo; Mr. Rymer described
himself &ldquo;as having been a few moments ago the happiest of
parents; but that his peace and that of his whole family had been
destroyed by Mr. Henry Norwynne, the dean&rsquo;s
nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now entered into a minute recital of Henry&rsquo;s frequent
visits there, and of all which had occurred in his house that
morning, from the suspicion that a child was concealed under his
roof, to the confession made by his youngest daughter of her fall
from virtue, and of her betrayer&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>The dean was astonished, shocked, and roused to anger: he
vented reproaches and menaces on his nephew; and &ldquo;blessing
himself in a virtuous son, whose wisdom and counsel were his only
solace in every care,&rdquo; sent for William to communicate with
him on this unhappy subject.</p>
<p>William came, all obedience, and heard with marks of amazement
and indignation the account of such black villainy!&nbsp; In
perfect sympathy with Mr. Rymer and his father, he allowed
&ldquo;no punishment could be too great for the seducer of
innocence, the selfish invader of a whole family&rsquo;s
repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nor did William here speak what he did not think&mdash;he
merely forgot his own conduct; or if he did recall it to his
mind, it was with some fair interpretations in his own behalf;
such as self-love ever supplies to those who wish to cheat
intruding conscience.</p>
<p>Young Henry being sent for to appear before this triumvirate,
he came with a light step and a cheerful face.&nbsp; But, on the
charge against him being exhibited, his countenance
changed&mdash;yet only to the expression of surprise!&nbsp; He
boldly asserted his innocence, plainly told the real fact, and
with a deportment so perfectly unembarrassed, that nothing but
the asseverations of the curate, &ldquo;that his daughter had
confessed the whole,&rdquo; could have rendered the story Henry
told suspected; although some of the incidents he related were of
no common kind.&nbsp; But Mr. Rymer&rsquo;s charge was an
objection to his veracity too potent to be overcome; and the dean
exclaimed in anger&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want not your avowal of your guilt&mdash;the
mother&rsquo;s evidence is testimony sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The virtuous Rebecca is not a mother,&rdquo; said
Henry, with firmness.</p>
<p>William here, like Rebecca&rsquo;s sisters, took Henry aside,
and warned him not to &ldquo;add to his offence by denying what
was proved against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Henry&rsquo;s spirit was too manly, his affection too
sincere, not to vindicate the chastity of her he loved, even at
his own peril.&nbsp; He again and again protested &ldquo;she was
virtuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her instantly be sent for,&rdquo; said the dean,
&ldquo;and this madman confronted with her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
adding, that as he wished everything might be conducted with
secrecy, he would not employ his clerk on the unhappy occasion:
he desired William to draw up the form of an oath, which he would
administer as soon as she arrived.</p>
<p>A man and horse were immediately despatched to bring Rebecca:
William drew up an affidavit as his father had directed
him&mdash;in <i>Rebecca&rsquo;s name solemnly protesting she was
a mother</i>, <i>and Henry the father of her child</i>.&nbsp; And
now, the dean, suppressing till she came the warmth of his
displeasure, spoke thus calmly to Henry:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even supposing that your improbable tale of having
found this child, and all your declarations in respect to it were
true, still you would be greatly criminal.&nbsp; What plea can
you make for not having immediately revealed the circumstance to
me or some other proper person, that the real mother might have
been detected and punished for her design of murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that, perhaps, I was to blame,&rdquo; returned
Henry: &ldquo;but whoever the mother was, I pitied
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compassion on such an occasion was unplaced,&rdquo;
said the dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I wrong, sir, to pity the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how could I feel for <i>that</i>, and yet divest
myself of all feeling for its mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its mother!&rdquo; exclaimed William, in anger:
&ldquo;she ought to have been immediately pursued, apprehended,
and committed to prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It struck me, cousin William,&rdquo; replied Henry,
&ldquo;that the father was more deserving of a prison: the poor
woman had abandoned only one&mdash;the man, in all likelihood,
had forsaken <i>two</i> pitiable creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William was pouring execrations &ldquo;on the villain if such
there could be,&rdquo; when Rebecca was announced.</p>
<p>Her eyes were half closed with weeping; deep confusion
overspread her face; and her tottering limbs could hardly support
her to the awful chamber where the dean, her father, and William
sat in judgment, whilst her beloved Henry stood arraigned as a
culprit, by her false evidence.</p>
<p>Upon her entrance, her father first addressed her, and said in
a stern, threatening, yet feeling tone, &ldquo;Unhappy girl,
answer me before all present&mdash;Have you, or have you not,
owned yourself a mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied, stealing a fearful look at Henry, &ldquo;I
have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you not,&rdquo; asked the dean, &ldquo;owned
that Henry Norwynne is the father of your child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed as if she wished to expostulate.</p>
<p>The curate raised his voice&mdash;&ldquo;Have you or have you
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; she faintly replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then here,&rdquo; cried the dean to William,
&ldquo;read that paper to her, and take the Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William read the paper, which in her name declared a momentous
falsehood: he then held the book in form, while she looked like
one distracted&mdash;wrung her hands, and was near sinking to the
earth.</p>
<p>At the moment when the book was lifted up to her lips to kiss,
Henry rushed to her&mdash;&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;Rebecca! do not wound your future peace.&nbsp; I plainly
see under what prejudices you have been accused, under what fears
you have fallen.&nbsp; But do not be terrified into the
commission of a crime which hereafter will distract your delicate
conscience.&nbsp; My requesting you of your father for my wife
will satisfy his scruples, prevent your oath&mdash;and here I
make the demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He at length confesses!&nbsp; Surprising
audacity!&nbsp; Complicated villainy!&rdquo; exclaimed the dean;
then added, &ldquo;Henry Norwynne, your first guilt is so
enormous; your second, in steadfastly denying it, so base, this
last conduct so audacious; that from the present hour you must
never dare to call me relation, or to consider my house as your
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William, in unison with his father, exclaimed, &ldquo;Indeed,
Henry, your actions merit this punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry answered with firmness, &ldquo;Inflict what punishment
you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the dean&rsquo;s permission, then,&rdquo; said the
curate, &ldquo;you must marry my daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry started&mdash;&ldquo;Do you pronounce that as a
punishment?&nbsp; It would be the greatest blessing Providence
could bestow.&nbsp; But how are we to live?&nbsp; My uncle is too
much offended ever to be my friend again; and in this country,
persons of a certain class are so educated, they cannot exist
without the assistance, or what is called the patronage, of
others: when that is withheld, they steal or starve.&nbsp; Heaven
protect Rebecca from such misfortune!&nbsp; Sir (to the curate),
do you but consent to support her only a year or two longer, and
in that time I will learn some occupation, that shall raise me to
the eminence of maintaining both her and myself without one
obligation, or one inconvenience, to a single being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebecca exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh! you have saved me from such a
weight of sin, that my future life would be too happy passed as
your slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear Rebecca, return to your father&rsquo;s
house, return to slavery but for a few years more, and the rest
of your life I will make free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can love you; and in that is comprised everything
that is kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate, who, bating a few passions and a few prejudices,
was a man of some worth and feeling, and felt, in the midst of
her distress, though the result of supposed crimes, that he loved
this neglected daughter better than he had before conceived; and
he now agreed &ldquo;to take her home for a time, provided she
were relieved from the child, and the matter so hushed up, that
it might draw no imputation upon the characters of his other
daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dean did not degrade his consequence by consultations of
this nature: but, having penetrated (as he imagined) into the
very bottom of this intricate story, and issued his mandate
against Henry, as a mark that he took no farther concern in the
matter, he proudly walked out of the room without uttering
another word.</p>
<p>William as proudly and silently followed.</p>
<p>The curate was inclined to adopt the manners of such great
examples: but self-interest, some affection to Rebecca, and
concern for the character of his family, made him wish to talk a
little more with Henry, who new repeated what he had said
respecting his marriage with Rebecca, and promised &ldquo;to come
the very next day in secret, and deliver her from the care of the
infant, and the suspicion that would attend her nursing
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, above all,&rdquo; said the curate, &ldquo;procure
your uncle&rsquo;s pardon; for without that, without his
protection, or the protection of some other rich man, to marry,
to obey God&rsquo;s ordinance, <i>increase and multiply</i> is to
want food for yourselves and your offspring.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<p>Though this unfortunate occurrence in the curate&rsquo;s
family was, according to his own phrase, &ldquo;to be hushed
up,&rdquo; yet certain persons of his, of the dean&rsquo;s, and
of Lord Bendham&rsquo;s house, immediately heard and talked of
it.&nbsp; Among these, Lady Bendham was most of all shocked and
offended: she said she &ldquo;never could bear to hear Mr. Rymer
either pray or preach again; he had not conducted himself with
proper dignity either as a clergyman or a father; he should have
imitated the dean&rsquo;s example in respect to Henry, and have
turned his daughter out of doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Bendham was less severe on the seduced, but had no mercy
on the seducer&mdash;&ldquo;a vicious youth, without one
accomplishment to endear vice.&rdquo;&nbsp; For vice, Lord
Bendham thought (with certain philosophers), might be most
exquisitely pleasing, in a pleasing garb.&nbsp; &ldquo;But this
youth sinned without elegance, without one particle of wit, or an
atom of good breeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clementina would not permit the subject to be mentioned a
second time in her hearing&mdash;extreme delicacy in woman she
knew was bewitching; and the delicacy she displayed on this
occasion went so far that she &ldquo;could not even intercede
with the dean to forgive his nephew, because the topic was too
gross for her lips to name even in the ear of her
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Sedgeley, though on the very eve of her bridal day with
William, felt so tender a regard for Henry, that often she
thought Rebecca happier in disgrace and poverty, blest with the
love of him, than she was likely to be in the possession of
friends and fortune with his cousin.</p>
<p>Had Henry been of a nature to suspect others of evil, or had
he felt a confidence in his own worth, such a passion as this
young woman&rsquo;s would soon have disclosed its existence: but
he, regardless of any attractions of Miss Sedgeley, equally
supposed he had none in her eyes; and thus, fortunately for the
peace of all parties, this prepossession ever remained a secret
except to herself.</p>
<p>So little did William conceive that his clownish cousin could
rival him in the affections of a woman of fashion, that he even
slightly solicited his father &ldquo;that Henry might not be
banished from the house, at least till after the following day,
when the great festival of his marriage was to be
celebrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the dean refused, and reminded his son, &ldquo;that he was
bound both by his moral and religious character, in the eyes of
God, and still more, in the eyes of men, to show lasting
resentment of iniquity like his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William acquiesced, and immediately delivered to his cousin
the dean&rsquo;s &ldquo;wishes for his amendment,&rdquo; and a
letter of recommendation procured from Lord Bendham, to introduce
him on board a man-of-war; where, he was told, &ldquo;he might
hope to meet with preferment, according to his merit, as a sailor
and a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry pressed William&rsquo;s hand on parting, wished him
happy in his marriage, and supplicated, as the only favour he
would implore, an interview with his uncle, to thank him for all
his former kindness, and to see him for the last time.</p>
<p>William repeated this petition to his father, but with so
little energy, that the dean did not grant it.&nbsp; He felt
himself, he said, compelled to resent that reprobate character in
which Henry had appeared; and he feared &ldquo;lest the
remembrance of his last parting from his brother might, on taking
a formal leave of that brother&rsquo;s son, reduce him to some
tokens of weakness, that would ill become his dignity and just
displeasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sent him his blessing, with money to convey him to the
ship, and Henry quitted his uncle&rsquo;s house in a flood of
tears, to seek first a new protectress for his little foundling,
and then to seek his fortune.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<p>The wedding-day of Mr. William Norwynne with Miss Caroline
Sedgeley arrived; and, on that day, the bells of every parish
surrounding that in which they lived joined with their own, in
celebration of the blissful union.&nbsp; Flowers were strewn
before the new-married pair, and favours and ale made many a
heart more gladsome than that of either bridegroom or bride.</p>
<p>Upon this day of ringing and rejoicing the bells were not
muffled, nor was conversation on the subject withheld from the
ear of Agnes!&nbsp; She heard like her neighbours; and sitting on
the side of her bed in her little chamber, suffered, under the
cottage roof, as much affliction as ever visited a palace.</p>
<p>Tyrants, who have embrued their hands in the blood of myriads
of their fellow-creatures, can call their murders
&ldquo;religion, justice, attention to the good of
mankind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Agnes knew no sophistry to calm
<i>her</i> sense of guilt: she felt herself a harlot and a
murderer; a slighted, a deserted wretch, bereft of all she loved
in this world, all she could hope for in the next.</p>
<p>She complained bitterly of illness, nor could the entreaties
of her father and mother prevail on her to share in the sports of
this general holiday.&nbsp; As none of her humble visitors
suspected the cause of her more than ordinary indisposition, they
endeavoured to divert it with an account of everything they had
seen at church&mdash;&ldquo;what the bride wore; how joyful the
bridegroom looked;&rdquo;&mdash;and all the seeming signs of that
complete happiness which they conceived was for certain
tasted.</p>
<p>Agnes, who, before this event, had at moments suppressed the
agonising sting of self-condemnation in the faint prospect of her
lover one day restored, on this memorable occasion lost every
glimpse of hope, and was weighed to the earth with an
accumulation of despair.</p>
<p>Where is the degree in which the sinner stops?&nbsp; Unhappy
Agnes! the first time you permitted indecorous familiarity from a
man who made you no promise, who gave you no hope of becoming his
wife, who professed nothing beyond those fervent, though slender,
affections which attach the rake to the wanton; the first time
you interpreted his kind looks and ardent prayers into tenderness
and constancy; the first time you descended from the character of
purity, you rushed imperceptibly on the blackest crimes.&nbsp;
The more sincerely you loved, the more you plunged in danger:
from one ungoverned passion proceeded a second and a third.&nbsp;
In the fervency of affection you yielded up your virtue!&nbsp; In
the excess of fear, you stained your conscience by the intended
murder of your child!&nbsp; And now, in the violence of grief,
you meditate&mdash;what?&mdash;to put an end to your existence by
your own hand!</p>
<p>After casting her thoughts around, anxious to find some bud of
comfort on which to fix her longing eye; she beheld, in the total
loss of William, nothing but a wide waste, an extensive plain of
anguish.&nbsp; &ldquo;How am I to be sustained through this
dreary journey of life?&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; Upon this
question she felt, more poignantly than ever, her loss of
innocence: innocence would have been her support, but, in place
of this best prop to the afflicted, guilt flashed on her memory
every time she flew for aid to reflection.</p>
<p>At length, from horrible rumination, a momentary alleviation
came: &ldquo;but one more step in wickedness,&rdquo; she
triumphantly said, &ldquo;and all my shame, all my sufferings are
over.&rdquo;&nbsp; She congratulated herself upon the lucky
thought; when, but an instant after, the tears trickled down her
face for the sorrow her death, her sinful death, would bring to
her poor and beloved parents.&nbsp; She then thought upon the
probability of a sigh it might draw from William; and, the pride,
the pleasure of that little tribute, counterpoised every struggle
on the side of life.</p>
<p>As she saw the sun decline, &ldquo;When you rise again,&rdquo;
she thought, &ldquo;when you peep bright to-morrow morning into
this little room to call me up, I shall not be here to open my
eyes upon a hateful day&mdash;I shall no more regret that you
have waked me!&mdash;I shall be sound asleep, never to wake again
in this wretched world&mdash;not even the voice of William would
then awake me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she found herself resolved, and evening just come on,
she hurried out of the house, and hastened to the fatal wood; the
scene of her dishonour&mdash;the scene of intended
murder&mdash;and now the meditated scene of suicide.</p>
<p>As she walked along between the close-set tree, she saw, at a
little distance, the spot where William first made love to her;
and where at every appointment he used to wait her coming.&nbsp;
She darted her eye away from this place with horror; but, after a
few moments of emotion, she walked slowly up to it&mdash;shed
tears, and pressed with her trembling lips that tree, against
which she was accustomed to lean while he talked with her.&nbsp;
She felt an inclination to make this the spot to die in; but her
preconcerted, and the less frightful death, of leaping into a
pool on the other side of the wood, induced her to go
onwards.</p>
<p>Presently, she came near the place where <i>her</i> child, and
<i>William&rsquo;s</i>, was exposed to perish.&nbsp; Here she
started with a sense of the most atrocious guilt; and her whole
frame shook with the dread of an approaching, an omnipotent
Judge, to sentence her for murder.</p>
<p>She halted, appalled, aghast, undetermined whether to exist
longer beneath the pressure of a criminal conscience, or die that
very hour, and meet her final condemnation.</p>
<p>She proceeded a few steps farther, and beheld the very
ivy-bush close to which her infant lay when she left him exposed;
and now, from this minute recollection, all the mother rising in
her soul, she saw, as it were, her babe again in its deserted
state; and bursting into tears of bitterest contrition and
compassion, she cried&mdash;&ldquo;As I was merciless to
<i>thee</i>, my child, thy father has been pitiless to
<i>me</i>!&nbsp; As I abandoned <i>thee</i> to die with cold and
hunger, he has forsaken, and has driven <i>me</i> to die by
self-slaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She now fixed her eager eyes on the distant pond, and walked
more nimbly than before, to rid herself of her agonising
sensations.</p>
<p>Just as she had nearly reached the wished-for brink, she heard
a footstep, and saw, by the glimmering of a clouded moon, a man
approaching.&nbsp; She turned out of her path, for fear her
intentions should be guessed at, and opposed; but still, as she
walked another way, her eye was wishfully bent towards the water
that was to obliterate her love and her remorse&mdash;obliterate,
forever, William and his child.</p>
<p>It was now that Henry, who, to prevent scandal, had stolen at
that still hour of night to rid the curate of the incumbrance so
irksome to him, and take the foundling to a woman whom he had
hired for the charge&mdash;it was now that Henry came up, with
the child of Agnes in his arms, carefully covered all over from
the night&rsquo;s dew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes, is it you?&rdquo; cried Henry, at a little
distance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you going thus late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, sir,&rdquo; said she, and rushed among the
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Agnes,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I want to bid you
farewell; to-morrow I am going to leave this part of the country
for a long time; so God bless you, Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, he stretched out his arm to shake her by the
hand.</p>
<p>Her poor heart, trusting that his blessing, for want of more
potent offerings, might, perhaps, at this tremendous crisis
ascend to Heaven in her behalf, she stopped, returned, and put
out her hand to take his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Softly!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t wake my
child; this spot has been a place of danger to him, for
underneath this very ivy-bush it was that I found him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found what?&rdquo; cried Agnes, with a voice elevated
to a tremulous scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not tell you the story,&rdquo; replied Henry;
&ldquo;for no one I have ever yet told of it would believe
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will believe you&mdash;I will believe you,&rdquo; she
repeated with tones yet more impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;only five weeks
ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; shrieked Agnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she articulated, in the same voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, as I was passing this very place, I wish I
may never speak truth again, if I did not find&rdquo; (here he
pulled aside the warm rug in which the infant was wrapped)
&ldquo;this beautiful child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a cord?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cord was round its neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis mine&mdash;the child is
mine&mdash;&rsquo;tis mine&mdash;my child&mdash;I am the mother
and the murderer&mdash;I fixed the cord, while the ground shook
under me&mdash;while flashes of fire darted before my
eyes!&mdash;while my heart was bursting with despair and
horror!&nbsp; But I stopped short&mdash;I did not draw the
noose&mdash;I had a moment of strength, and I ran away.&nbsp; I
left him living&mdash;he is living now&mdash;escaped from my
hands&mdash;and I am no longer ashamed, but overcome with joy
that he is mine!&nbsp; I bless you, my dear, my dear, for saving
his life&mdash;for giving him to me again&mdash;for preserving
<i>my</i> life, as well as my child&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she took her infant, pressed it to her lips and to her
bosom; then bent to the ground, clasped Henry&rsquo;s knees, and
wept upon his feet.</p>
<p>He could not for a moment doubt the truth of what she said;
her powerful yet broken accents, her convulsive embraces of the
child, even more than her declaration, convinced him she was its
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heaven!&rdquo; cried Henry, &ldquo;and this is my
cousin William&rsquo;s child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your cousin does not know it,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;I never told him&mdash;he was not kind enough to embolden
me; therefore do not blame <i>him</i> for <i>my</i> sin; he did
not know of my wicked designs&mdash;he did not encourage
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he forsook you, Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never said he would not.&nbsp; He always told me he
could not marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you so at his first private
meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor at the second?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; nor yet at the third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was it he told you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forget the exact time; but I remember it was on that
very evening when I confessed to him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he had won my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you confess it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he asked me and said it would make him happy if
I would say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cruel! dishonourable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, do not blame him; he cannot help <i>not</i> loving
me, no more than I can help <i>loving</i> him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, you weep!&nbsp; I always heard that you were
brought up in a savage country; but I suppose it is a mistake; it
was your cousin William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will not you apply to him for the support of your
child?&rdquo; asked Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought he would not be angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angry!&nbsp; I will write to him on the subject if you
will give me leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do not say it is by my desire.&nbsp; Do not say I
wish to trouble him.&nbsp; I would sooner beg than be a trouble
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so delicate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for my own sake; I wish him not to hate
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, thus you may secure his respect.&nbsp; I will
write to him, and let him know all the circumstances of your
case.&nbsp; I will plead for his compassion on his child, but
assure him that no conduct of his will ever induce you to declare
(except only to me, who knew of your previous acquaintance) who
is the father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this she consented; but when Henry offered to take from her
the infant, and carry him to the nurse he had engaged, to this
she would not consent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean, then, to acknowledge him yours?&rdquo;
Henry asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing shall force me to part from him again.&nbsp; I
will keep him, and let my neighbours judge of me as they
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Henry caught at a hope he feared to name before.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You will then have no objection,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
clear an unhappy girl to a few friends, with whom her character
has suffered by becoming, at my request, his nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will clear any one, so that I do not accuse the
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give me leave, then, in your name, to tell the
whole story to some particular friends, my cousin William&rsquo;s
part in it alone excepted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry now exclaimed, &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; with greater
fervour than when he spoke it before; and he now hoped the night
was nearly gone, that the time might be so much the shorter
before Rebecca should be reinstated in the esteem of her father,
and of all those who had misjudged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless <i>you</i>!&rdquo; said Agnes, still more
fervently, as she walked with unguided steps towards her home;
for her eyes never wandered from the precious object which caused
her unexpected return.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<p>Henry rose early in the morning, and flew to the
curate&rsquo;s house, with more than even his usual thirst of
justice, to clear injured innocence, to redeem from shame her
whom he loved.&nbsp; With eager haste he told that he had found
the mother, whose fall from virtue Rebecca, overcome by confusion
and threats, had taken on herself.</p>
<p>Rebecca rejoiced, but her sisters shook their heads, and even
the father seemed to doubt.</p>
<p>Confident in the truth of his story, Henry persisted so boldly
in his affirmations, that if Mr. Rymer did not entirely believe
what he said, he secretly hoped that the dean and other people
might; therefore he began to imagine he could possibly cast from
<i>his</i> family the present stigma, whether or no it belonged
to any other.</p>
<p>No sooner was Henry gone than Mr. Rymer waited on the dean to
report what he had heard; and he frankly attributed his
daughter&rsquo;s false confession to the compulsive methods he
had adopted in charging her with the offence.&nbsp; Upon this
statement, Henry&rsquo;s love to her was also a solution of his
seemingly inconsistent conduct on that singular occasion.</p>
<p>The dean immediately said, &ldquo;I will put the matter beyond
all doubt; for I will this moment send for the present reputed
mother; and if she acknowledges the child, I will instantly
commit her to prison for the attempt of putting it to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate applauded the dean&rsquo;s sagacity; a warrant was
issued, and Agnes brought prisoner before the grandfather of her
child.</p>
<p>She appeared astonished at the peril in which she found
herself.&nbsp; Confused, also, with a thousand inexpressible
sensations which the dean&rsquo;s presence inspired, she seemed
to prevaricate in all she uttered.&nbsp; Accused of this
prevarication, she was still more disconcerted; said, and unsaid;
confessed herself the mother of the infant, but declared she did
not know, then owned she <i>did</i> know, the name of the man who
had undone her, but would never utter it.&nbsp; At length she
cast herself on her knees before the father of her betrayer, and
supplicated &ldquo;he would not punish her with severity, as she
most penitently confessed her fault, so far as is related to
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Mr. and Mrs. Norwynne, just entered on the honeymoon,
were sitting side by side enjoying with peace and with honour
conjugal society, poor Agnes, threatened, reviled, and sinking to
the dust, was hearing from the mouth of William&rsquo;s father
the enormity of those crimes to which his son had been
accessory.&nbsp; She saw the mittimus written that was to convey
her into a prison&mdash;saw herself delivered once more into the
hands of constables, before her resolution left her, of
concealing the name of William in her story.&nbsp; She now,
overcome with affright, and thinking she should expose him still
more in a public court, if hereafter on her trial she should be
obliged to name him&mdash;she now humbly asked the dean to hear a
few words she had to say in private, where she promised she
&ldquo;would speak nothing but the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was impossible, he said&mdash;&ldquo;No private
confessions before a magistrate!&nbsp; All must be done
openly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She urged again and again the same request: it was denied more
peremptorily than at first.&nbsp; On which she
said&mdash;&ldquo;Then, sir, forgive me, since you force me to
it, if I speak before Mr. Rymer and these men what I would for
ever have kept a secret if I could.&nbsp; One of your family is
my child&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any of my servants?&rdquo; cried the dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; one who is nearer still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come this way,&rdquo; said the dean; &ldquo;I
<i>will</i> speak to you in private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not that the dean, as a magistrate, distributed partial
decrees of pretended justice&mdash;he was rigidly faithful to his
trust: he would not inflict punishment on the innocent, nor let
the guilty escape; but in all particulars of refined or coarse
treatment he would alleviate or aggravate according to the rank
of the offender.&nbsp; He could not feel that a secret was of
equal importance to a poor as to a rich person; and while Agnes
gave no intimation but that her delicacy rose from fears for
herself, she did not so forcibly impress him with an opinion that
it was a case which had weighty cause for a private conference as
when she boldly said, &ldquo;a part of <i>his</i> family, very
near to him, was concerned in her tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final result of their conversation in an adjoining room
was&mdash;a charge from the dean, in the words of Mr. Rymer,
&ldquo;to hush the affair up,&rdquo; and his promise that the
infant should be immediately taken from her, and that &ldquo;she
should have no more trouble with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no trouble with it,&rdquo; replied Agnes:
&ldquo;my child is now all my comfort, and I cannot part from
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you inconsistent woman, did you not attempt to
murder it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was before I had nursed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis necessary you should give it up: it must be
sent some miles away; and then the whole circumstance will be
soon forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> shall never forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter; you must give up the child.&nbsp; Do not
some of our first women of quality part with their
children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women of quality have other things to love&mdash;I have
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would you occasion my son and his new-made bride
the shame and the uneasiness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Agnes burst into a flood of tears; and being angrily
asked by the dean &ldquo;why she blubbered so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> have had shame and uneasiness,&rdquo; she
replied, wringing her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you deserve them: they are the sure attendants of
crimes such as yours.&nbsp; If you allured and entrapped a young
man like my son&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the youngest by five years,&rdquo; said Agnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, repent,&rdquo; returned the dean;
&ldquo;repent, and resign your child.&nbsp; Repent, and you may
yet marry an honest man who knows nothing of the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And repent too?&rdquo; asked Agnes.</p>
<p>Not the insufferable ignorance of young Henry, when he first
came to England, was more vexatious or provoking to the dean than
the rustic simplicity of poor Agnes&rsquo;s uncultured
replies.&nbsp; He at last, in an offended and determined manner,
told her&mdash;&ldquo;That if she would resign the child, and
keep the father&rsquo;s name a secret, not only the child should
be taken care of, but she herself might, perhaps, receive some
favours; but if she persisted in her imprudent folly, she must
expect no consideration on her own account; nor should she be
allowed, for the maintenance of the boy, a sixpence beyond the
stated sum for a poor man&rsquo;s unlawful
offspring.&rdquo;&nbsp; Agnes, resolving not to be separated from
her infant, bowed resignation to this last decree; and, terrified
at the loud words and angry looks of the dean, after being
regularly discharged, stole to her home, where the smiles of her
infant, and the caresses she lavished on it, repaid her for the
sorrows she had just suffered for its sake.</p>
<p>Let it here be observed that the dean, on suffering Agnes to
depart without putting in force the law against her as he had
threatened, did nothing, as it were, <i>behind the
curtain</i>.&nbsp; He openly and candidly owned, on his return to
Mr. Rymer, his clerk, and the two constables who were attending,
&ldquo;that an affair of some little gallantry, in which he was
extremely sorry to say his son was rather too nearly involved,
required, in consideration of his recent marriage, and an
excellent young woman&rsquo;s (his bride&rsquo;s) happiness, that
what had occurred should not be publicly talked of; therefore he
had thought proper only to reprimand the hussy, and send her
about her business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curate assured the dean, &ldquo;that upon this, and upon
all other occasions, which should, would, or <i>could</i> occur,
he owed to his judgment, as his superior, implicit
obedience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk and the two constables most properly said,
&ldquo;his honour was a gentleman, and of course must know better
how to act than they.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p>The pleasure of a mother which Agnes experienced did not make
her insensible to the sorrow of a daughter.</p>
<p>Her parents had received the stranger child, along with a
fabricated tale she told &ldquo;of its appertaining to
another,&rdquo; without the smallest suspicion; but, by the
secret diligence of the curate, and the nimble tongues of his
elder daughters, the report of all that had passed on the subject
of this unfortunate infant soon circulated through the village;
and Agnes in a few weeks had seen her parents pine away in grief
and shame at her loss of virtue.</p>
<p>She perceived the neighbours avoid, or openly sneer at
<i>her</i>; but that was little&mdash;she saw them slight her
aged father and mother upon her account; and she now took the
resolution rather to perish for want in another part of the
country than live where she was known, and so entail an infamy
upon the few who loved her.&nbsp; She slightly hoped, too, that
by disappearing from the town and neighbourhood some little
reward might be allowed her for her banishment by the
dean&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; In that she was deceived.&nbsp; No
sooner was she gone, indeed, than her guilt was forgotten; but
with her guilt her wants.&nbsp; The dean and his family rejoiced
at her and her child&rsquo;s departure; but as this mode she had
chosen chanced to be no specified condition in the terms proposed
to her, they did not think they were bound to pay her for it; and
while she was too fearful and bashful to solicit the dean, and
too proud (forlorn as she was) to supplicate his son, they both
concluded she &ldquo;wanted for nothing;&rdquo; for to be poor,
and too delicate to complain, they deemed incompatible.</p>
<p>To heighten the sense of her degraded, friendless situation,
she knew that Henry had not been unmindful of his promise to her,
but that he had applied to his cousin in her and his
child&rsquo;s behalf; for he had acquainted her that
William&rsquo;s answer was&mdash;&ldquo;all obligations on
<i>his</i> part were now undertaken by his father; for that,
Agnes having chosen (in a fit of malignity upon his marriage) to
apprise the dean of their former intercourse, such conduct had
for ever cancelled all attention due from him to her, or to her
child, beyond what its bare maintenance exacted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In vain had Henry explained to him, by a second application,
the predicament in which poor Agnes was involved before she
consented to reveal her secret to his father.&nbsp; William was
happy in an excuse to rid himself of a burthen, and he seemed to
believe, what he wished to be true&mdash;that she had forfeited
all claim to his farther notice.</p>
<p>Henry informed her of this unkind reception of his efforts in
her favour in as gentle terms as possible, for she excited his
deepest compassion.&nbsp; Perhaps our <i>own</i> misfortunes are
the cause of our pity for others, even more than <i>their</i>
ills; and Henry&rsquo;s present sorrows had softened his heart to
peculiar sympathy in woe.&nbsp; He had unhappily found that the
ardour which had hurried him to vindicate the reputation of
Rebecca was likely to deprive him of the blessing of her ever
becoming his proved an offender instead of his wife; for the
dean, chagrined that his son was at length nephew, submitted to
the temptation of punishing the latter, while he forgave the
former.&nbsp; He sent for Henry, and having coldly congratulated
him on his and Rebecca&rsquo;s innocence, represented to him the
impropriety of marrying the daughter of a poor curate, and laid
his commands on him, &ldquo;never to harbour such an intention
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry found this restriction so severe that he
would not promise obedience; but on his next attempt to visit
Rebecca he met a positive repulse from her father, who signified
to him, &ldquo;that the dean had forbidden him to permit their
farther acquaintance;&rdquo; and the curate declared &ldquo;that,
for his own part, he had no will, judgment, or faculties, but
that he submitted in all things to the superior
clergy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the very time young Henry had received the proposal from
Mr. Rymer of his immediate union with his daughter, and the dean
had made no objection Henry waived the happiness for the time
present, and had given a reason why he wished it postponed.&nbsp;
The reason he then gave had its weight; but he had another
concealed, of yet more import.&nbsp; Much as he loved, and looked
forward with rapture to that time when every morning, every
evening, and all the day, he should have the delight of
Rebecca&rsquo;s society, still there was one other wish nearer
his heart than this one desire which for years had been foremost
in his thoughts, and which not even love could eradicate.&nbsp;
He longed, he pined to know what fate had befallen his
father.&nbsp; Provided he were living, he could conceive no joy
so great as that of seeing him!&nbsp; If he were dead, he was
anxious to pay the tribute of filial piety he owed, by satisfying
his affectionate curiosity in every circumstance of the sad
event.</p>
<p>While a boy he had frequently expressed these sentiments to
both his uncle and his cousin; sometimes they apprised him of the
total improbability of accomplishing his wishes; at other times,
when they saw the disappointment weigh heavy on his mind, they
bade him &ldquo;wait till he was a man before he could hope to
put his designs in execution.&rdquo;&nbsp; He did wait.&nbsp; But
on the very day he arrived at the age of twenty-one, he made a
vow&mdash;&ldquo;that to gain intelligence of his father should
be the first important act of his free will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Previously to this time he had made all the inquiries
possible, whether any new adventure to that part of Africa in
which he was bred was likely to be undertaken.&nbsp; Of this
there appeared to be no prospect till the intended expedition to
Sierra Leone was announced, and which favoured his hope of being
able to procure a passage, among those adventurers, so near to
the island on which his father was (or had been) prisoner, as to
obtain an opportunity of visiting it by stealth.</p>
<p>Fearing contention, or the being dissuaded from his plans if
he communicated them, he not only formed them in private, but he
kept them secretly; and, his imagination filled with the
kindness, the tenderness, the excess of fondness he had
experienced from his father, beyond any other person in the
world, he had thought with delight on the separation from all his
other kindred, to pay his duty to him, or to his revered
memory.&nbsp; Of late, indeed, there had been an object
introduced to his acquaintance, from whom it was bitter to part;
but his designs had been planned and firmly fixed before he knew
Rebecca; nor could he have tasted contentment even with her at
the expense of his piety to his father.</p>
<p>In the last interview he had with the dean, Henry, perceiving
that his disposition towards him was not less harsh than when a
few days before he had ordered him on board a vessel, found this
the proper time to declare his intentions of accompanying the
fleet to Sierra Leone.&nbsp; His uncle expressed surprise, but
immediately gave him a sum of money in addition to that he had
sent him before, and as much as he thought might defray his
expenses; and, as he gave it, by his willingness, his look, and
his accent, he seemed to say, &ldquo;I foresee this is the last
you will ever require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young William, though a very dutiful son, was amazed when he
heard of Henry&rsquo;s project, as &ldquo;the serious and settled
resolution of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Clementina, Lord and Lady Bendham, and twenty others,
&ldquo;wished him a successful voyage,&rdquo; and thought no more
about him.</p>
<p>It was for Rebecca alone to feel the loss of Henry; it was for
a mind like hers alone to know his worth; nor did this last proof
of it, the quitting her for one who claimed by every tie a
preference, lessen him in her esteem.&nbsp; When, by a message
from him, she became acquainted with his design, much as it
interfered with her happiness, she valued him the more for this
observance of his duty; the more regretted his loss, and the more
anxiously prayed for his return&mdash;a return which he, in the
following letter, written just before his departure, taught her
to hope for with augmented impatience.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear
Rebecca</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not tell you I am sorry to part from you&mdash;you
know I am&mdash;and you know all I have suffered since your
father denied me permission to see you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps you do not know the hopes I enjoy, and
which bestow on me a degree of peace; and those I am eager to
tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope, Rebecca, to see you again; I hope to return to
England, and overcome every obstacle to our marriage; and then,
in whatever station we are placed, I shall consider myself as
happy as it is possible to be in this world.&nbsp; I feel a
conviction that you would be happy also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some persons, I know, estimate happiness by fine
houses, gardens, and parks; others by pictures, horses, money,
and various things wholly remote from their own species; but when
I wish to ascertain the real felicity of any rational man, I
always inquire <i>whom he has to love</i>.&nbsp; If I find he has
nobody, or does not love those he has, even in the midst of all
his profusion of finery and grandeur, I pronounce him a being in
deep adversity.&nbsp; In loving you, I am happier than my cousin
William; even though I am obliged to leave you for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be afraid you should grow old before I return;
age can never alter you in my regard.&nbsp; It is your gentle
nature, your unaffected manners, your easy cheerfulness, your
clear understanding, the sincerity of all your words and actions
which have gained my heart; and while you preserve charms like
these, you will be dearer to me with white hairs and a wrinkled
face than any of your sex, who, not possessing all these
qualities, possess the form and features of perfect beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will esteem me, too, I trust, though I should
return on crutches with my poor father, whom I may be obliged to
maintain by daily labour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall employ all my time, during my absence, in the
study of some art which may enable me to support you both,
provided Heaven will bestow two such blessings on me.&nbsp; In
the cheering thought that it will be so, and in that only, I have
the courage, my dear, dear Rebecca, to say to you</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&nbsp; <span class="smcap">H.

</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<p>Before Henry could receive a reply to his letter, the fleet in
which he sailed put to sea.</p>
<p>By his absence, not only Rebecca was deprived of the friend
she loved, but poor Agnes lost a kind and compassionate
adviser.&nbsp; The loss of her parents, too, she had to mourn;
for they both sickened, and both died, in a short time after; and
now wholly friendless in her little exile, where she could only
hope for toleration, not being known, she was contending with
suspicion, rebuffs, disappointments, and various other ills,
which might have made the most rigorous of her Anfield
persecutors feel compassion for her, could they have witnessed
the throbs of her heart, and all the deep wounds there
imprinted.</p>
<p>Still, there are few persons whom Providence afflicts beyond
the limits of <i>all</i> consolation; few cast so low as not to
feel pride on <i>certain</i> occasions; and Agnes felt a comfort
and a dignity in the thought, that she had both a mind and a body
capable of sustaining every hardship, which her destiny might
inflict, rather than submit to the disgrace of soliciting
William&rsquo;s charity a second time.</p>
<p>This determination was put to a variety of trials.&nbsp; In
vain she offered herself to the strangers of the village in which
she was accidentally cast as a servant; her child, her dejected
looks, her broken sentences, a wildness in her eye, a kind of
bold despair which at times overspread her features, her
imperfect story who and what she was, prejudiced all those to
whom she applied; and, after thus travelling to several small
towns and hamlets, the only employer she could obtain was a
farmer; and the only employment to tend and feed his cattle while
his men were in the harvest, tilling the ground, or at some other
labour which required at the time peculiar expedition.</p>
<p>Though Agnes was born of peasants, yet, having been the only
child of industrious parents, she had been nursed with a
tenderness and delicacy ill suited to her present occupation; but
she endured it with patience; and the most laborious part would
have seemed light could she have dismissed the
reflection&mdash;what it was that had reduced her to such a
state.</p>
<p>Soon her tender hands became hard and rough, her fair skin
burnt and yellow; so that when, on a Sunday, she has looked in
the glass, she has started back as if it were some other face she
saw instead of her own.&nbsp; But this loss of beauty gave her no
regret&mdash;while William did not see her, it was indifferent to
her, whether she were beautiful or hideous.&nbsp; On the features
of her child only, she now looked with joy; there, she fancied
she saw William at every glance, and, in the fond imagination,
felt at times every happiness short of seeing him.</p>
<p>By herding with the brute creation, she and her child were
allowed to live together; and this was a state she preferred to
the society of human creatures, who would have separated her from
what she loved so tenderly.&nbsp; Anxious to retain a service in
which she possessed such a blessing, care and attention to her
humble office caused her master to prolong her stay through all
the winter; then, during the spring, she tended his yeaning
sheep; in the summer, watched them as they grazed; and thus
season after season passed, till her young son could afford her
assistance in her daily work.</p>
<p>He now could charm her with his conversation as well as with
his looks: a thousand times in the transports of parental love
she has pressed him to her bosom, and thought, with an agony of
horror, upon her criminal, her mad intent to destroy what was now
so dear, so necessary to her existence.</p>
<p>Still the boy grew up more and more like his father.&nbsp; In
one resemblance alone he failed; he loved Agnes with an affection
totally distinct from the pitiful and childish gratification of
his own self-love; he never would quit her side for all the
tempting offers of toys or money; never would eat of rarities
given to him till Agnes took a part; never crossed her will,
however contradictory to his own; never saw her smile that he did
not laugh; nor did she ever weep, but he wept too.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<p>From the mean subject of oxen, sheep, and peasants, we return
to personages; i.e., persons of rank and fortune.&nbsp; The
bishop, who was introduced in the foregoing pages, but who has
occupied a very small space there, is now mentioned again, merely
that the reader may know he is at present in the same state as
his writings&mdash;dying; and that his friend, the dean, is
talked of as the most likely successor to his dignified
office.</p>
<p>The dean, most assuredly, had a strong friendship for the
bishop, and now, most assuredly, wished him to recover; and yet,
when he reflected on the success of his pamphlet a few years
past, and of many which he had written since on the very same
subject, he could not but think &ldquo;that he had more righteous
pretensions to fill the vacant seat of his much beloved and
reverend friend (should fate ordain it to be vacated) than any
other man;&rdquo; and he knew that it would not take one moment
from that friend&rsquo;s remaining life, should he exert himself,
with all due management, to obtain the elevated station when be
should he no more.</p>
<p>In presupposing the death of a friend, the dean, like many
other virtuous men, &ldquo;always supposed him going to a better
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; With perfect resignation, therefore, he
waited whatever change might happen to the bishop, ready to
receive him with open arms if he recovered, or equally ready, in
case of his dissolution, to receive his dignities.</p>
<p>Lady Clementina displayed her sensibility and feeling for the
sick prelate by the extravagance of hysteric fits; except at
those times when she talked seriously with her husband upon the
injustice which she thought would be done to him, and to his many
pamphlets and sermons, if he did not immediately rise to
episcopal honour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, dean,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;should you be
disappointed upon this occasion, you will write no more books for
the good of your country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;but the next
book I write for the good of my country shall be very different,
nay the very reverse of those I have already written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, dean! would you show yourself changed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I will show that my country is
changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! since you produced your last work; only six weeks
ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great changes may occur in six days,&rdquo; replied the
dean, with a threatening accent; &ldquo;and if I find things
<i>have</i> taken a new and improper turn, I will be the first to
expose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But before you act in this manner, my dear, surely you
will wait&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wait until the see is disposed of to
another,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>He did wait: the bishop died.&nbsp; The dean was promoted to
the see of ---, and wrote a folio on the prosperity of our happy
country.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p>While the bishop and his son were sailing before prosperous
gales on the ocean of life, young Henry was contending with
adverse winds, and many other perils, on the watery ocean; yet
still, his distresses and dangers were less than those which
Agnes had to encounter upon land.&nbsp; The sea threatens an
untimely death; the shore menaces calamities from which death is
a refuge.</p>
<p>The affections she had already experienced could just admit of
aggravation: the addition occurred.</p>
<p>Had the good farmer, who made her the companion of his flocks
and herds, lived till now, till now she might have been secure
from the annoyance of human kind; but, thrown once more upon
society, she was unfit to sustain the conflict of decorum against
depravity.&nbsp; Her master, her patron, her preserver, was dead;
and hardly as she had earned the pittance she received from him,
she found that it surpassed her power to obtain the like
again.&nbsp; Her doubtful character, her capacious mind, her
unmethodical manners, were still badly suited to the nice
precision of a country housewife; and as the prudent mistress of
a family sneered at her pretensions, she, in her turn, scorned
the narrow-minded mistress of a family.</p>
<p>In her inquiries how to gain her bread free from the cutting
reproaches of discretion, she was informed &ldquo;that London was
the only private corner, where guilt could be secreted
undisturbed; and the only public place where, in open day, it
might triumphantly stalk, attended by a chain of audacious
admirers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a charm to the ear of Agnes in the name of London,
which thrilled through her soul.&nbsp; William lived in London;
and she thought that, while she retired to some dark cellar with
her offences, he probably would ride in state with his, and she
at humble distance might sometimes catch a glance at him.</p>
<p>As difficult as to eradicate insanity from a mind once
possessed, so difficult it is to erase from the lover&rsquo;s
breast the deep impression of a <i>real</i> affection.&nbsp;
Coercion may prevail for a short interval, still love will rage
again.&nbsp; Not all the ignominy which Agnes experienced in the
place where she now was without a home&mdash;not the hunger which
she at times suffered, and even at times saw her child
endure&mdash;not every inducement for going to London, or motive
for quitting her present desolate station, had the weight to
affect her choice so much as&mdash;in London, she should live
nearer William; in the present spot she could never hope to see
him again, but there she might chance to pass him in the streets;
she might pass his house every day unobserved&mdash;might inquire
about him of his inferior neighbours, who would be unsuspicious
of the cause of her curiosity.&nbsp; For these gratifications,
she should imbibe new fortitude; for these she could bear all
hardships which London threatened; and for these, she at length
undertook a three weeks&rsquo; journey to that perilous town on
foot, cheering, as she walked along, her innocent and wearied
companion.</p>
<p>William&mdash;in your luxurious dwelling, possessed of coffers
filled with gold, relations, friends, clients, joyful around you,
delicious viands and rich wines upon your sumptuous board,
voluptuousness displayed in every apartment of your
habitation&mdash;contemplate, for a moment, Agnes, your first
love, with her son, your first and only child, walking through
frost and snow to London, with a foreboding fear on the mother
that, when arrived, they both may perish for the want of a
friend.</p>
<p>But no sooner did Agnes find herself within the smoke of the
metropolis than the old charm was renewed; and scarcely had she
refreshed her child at the poor inn at which she stopped than she
inquired how far it was to that part of the town where William,
she knew, resided?</p>
<p>She received for answer, &ldquo;about two miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this information, she thought that she would keep in
reserve, till some new sorrow befell her, the consolation of
passing his door (perchance of seeing him) which must ever be an
alleviation of her grief.&nbsp; It was not long before she had
occasion for more substantial comfort.&nbsp; She soon found she
was not likely to obtain a service here, more than in the
country.&nbsp; Some objected that she could not make caps and
gowns; some that she could not preserve and pickle; some, that
she was too young; some, that she was too pretty; and all
declined accepting her, till at last a citizen&rsquo;s wife, on
condition of her receiving but half the wages usually given, took
her as a servant of all work.</p>
<p>In romances, and in some plays, there are scenes of dark and
unwholesome mines, wherein the labourer works, during the
brightest day, by the aid of artificial light.&nbsp; There are in
London kitchens equally dismal though not quite so much exposed
to damp and noxious vapours.&nbsp; In one of these, underground,
hidden from the cheerful light of the sun, poor Agnes was doomed
to toil from morning till night, subjected to the command of a
dissatisfied mistress; who, not estimating as she ought the
misery incurred by serving her, constantly threatened her
servants &ldquo;with a dismission;&rdquo; at which the unthinking
wretches would tremble merely from the sound of the words; for to
have reflected&mdash;to have considered what their purport
was&mdash;&ldquo;to be released from a dungeon, relieved from
continual upbraidings, and vile drudgery,&rdquo; must have been a
subject of rejoicing; and yet, because these good tidings were
delivered as a menace, custom had made the hearer fearful of the
consequence.&nbsp; So, death being described to children as a
disaster, even poverty and shame will start from it with
affright; whereas, had it been pictured with its benign aspect,
it would have been feared but by few, and many, many would
welcome it with gladness.</p>
<p>All the care of Agnes to please, her fear of offending, her
toilsome days, her patience, her submission, could not prevail on
her she served to retain her one hour after, by chance, she had
heard &ldquo;that she was the mother of a child; that she wished
it should be kept a secret; and that she stole out now and then
to visit him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agnes, with swimming eyes and an almost breaking heart, left a
place&mdash;where to have lived one hour would have plunged any
fine lady in the deepest grief.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<p>Agnes was driven from service to service&mdash;her deficiency
in the knowledge of a mere drudge, or her lost character, pursued
her wherever she went&mdash;at length, becoming wholly destitute,
she gladly accepted a place where the latter misfortune was not
of the least impediment.</p>
<p>In one of these habitations, where continual misery is dressed
in continual smiles; where extreme of poverty is concealed by
extreme of finery; where wine dispenses mirth only by dispensing
forgetfulness; and where female beauty is so cheap, so complying,
that, while it inveigles, it disgusts the man of pleasure: in one
of those houses, to attend upon its wretched inhabitants, Agnes
was hired.&nbsp; Her feelings of rectitude submitted to those of
hunger; her principles of virtue (which the loss of virtue had
not destroyed) received a shock when she engaged to be the
abettor of vice, from which her delicacy, morality, and religion
shrunk; but persons of honour and of reputation would not employ
her: was she then to perish?&nbsp; That, perhaps, was easy to
resolve; but she had a child to leave behind! a child, from whom
to part for a day was a torment.&nbsp; Yet, before she submitted
to a situation which filled her mind with a kind of loathing
horror, often she paced up and down the street in which William
lived, looked wistfully at his house, and sometimes, lost to all
her finer feelings of independent pride, thought of sending a
short petition to him; but, at the idea of a repulse, and of that
frowning brow which she knew William <i>could</i> dart on her
petitions, she preferred death, or the most degrading life, to
the trial.</p>
<p>It was long since that misfortune and dishonour had made her
callous to the good or ill opinion of all the world, except
<i>his</i>; and the fear of drawing upon her his increased
contempt was still, at the crisis of applying, so powerful, that
she found she dared not hazard a reproof from him even in the
person of his father, whose rigour she had already more than once
experienced, in the frequent harsh messages conveyed to her with
the poor stipend for her boy.</p>
<p>Awed by the rigid and pious character of the new bishop, the
growing reputation, and rising honours of his son, she mistook
the appearance of moral excellence for moral excellence itself,
and felt her own unworthiness even to become the supplicant of
those great men.</p>
<p>Day after day she watched those parts of the town through
which William&rsquo;s chariot was accustomed to drive; but to see
the <i>carriage</i> was all to which she aspired; a feeling, not
to be described, forced her to cast her eyes upon the earth as it
drew near to her; and when it had passed, she beat her breast,
and wept that she had not seen <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>Impressed with the superiority of others, and her own abject
and disgustful state, she cried, &ldquo;Let me herd with those
who won&rsquo;t despise me; let me only see faces whereon I can
look without confusion and terror; let me associate with wretches
like myself, rather than force my shame before those who are so
good they can but scorn and hate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a mind thus languishing for sympathy in disgrace, she
entered a servant in the house just now described.&nbsp; There
disregarding the fatal proverb against &ldquo;<i>evil
communications</i>,&rdquo; she had not the firmness to be an
exception to the general rule.&nbsp; That pliant disposition,
which had yielded to the licentious love of William, stooped to
still baser prostitution in company still more depraved.</p>
<p>At first she shuddered at those practices she saw, at those
conversations she heard, and blest herself that poverty, not
inclination, had caused her to be a witness of such profligacy,
and had condemned her in this vile abode to be a servant, rather
than in the lower rank of mistress.&nbsp; Use softened those
horrors every day; at length self-defence, the fear of ridicule,
and the hope of favour, induced her to adopt that very conduct
from which her heart revolted.</p>
<p>In her sorrowful countenance and fading charms there yet
remained attraction for many visitors; and she now submitted to
the mercenary profanations of love, more odious, as her mind had
been subdued by its most captivating, most endearing joys.</p>
<p>While incessant regret whispered to her &ldquo;that she ought
to have endured every calamity rather than this,&rdquo; she thus
questioned her nice sense of wrong, &ldquo;Why, why respect
myself, since no other respects me?&nbsp; Why set a value on my
own feelings when no one else does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Degraded in her own judgment, she doubted her own
understanding when it sometimes told her she had deserved better
treatment; for she felt herself a fool in comparison with her
learned seducer and the rest who despised her.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
why,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;should I ungratefully persist
to contemn women who alone are so kind as to accept me for a
companion?&nbsp; Why refuse conformity to their customs, since
none of my sex besides will admit me to their society a partaker
of virtuous habits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In speculation these arguments appeared reasonable, and she
pursued their dictates; but in the practice of the life in which
she plunged she proved the fallacy of the system, and at times
tore her hair with frantic sorrow, that she had not continued in
the mid-way of guilt, and so preserved some portion of
self-approbation, to recompense her in a small degree, for the
total loss of the esteem of all the reputable world.</p>
<p>But she had gone too far to recede.&nbsp; Could she now have
recalled her innocence, even that remnant she brought with her to
London, experience would have taught her to have given up her
child, lived apart from him, and once more with the brute
creation, rather than to have mingled with her present
society.&nbsp; Now, alas! the time for flying was past; all
prudent choice was over, even all reflection was gone for ever,
or only admitted on compulsion, when it imperiously forced its
way amidst the scenes of tumultuous mirth or licentious passion,
of distracted riot, shameless effrontery, and wild intoxication,
when it <i>would</i> force its way, even through the walls of a
brothel.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<p>Is there a reader so little experienced in the human heart, so
forgetful of his own, as not to feel the possibility of the
following fact?</p>
<p>A series of uncommon calamities had been for many years the
lot of the elder Henry; a succession of prosperous events had
fallen to the share of his brother William.&nbsp; The one was the
envy, while the other had the compassion, of all who thought
about them.&nbsp; For the last twenty years, William had lived in
affluence, bordering upon splendour, his friends, his fame, his
fortune, daily increasing, while Henry throughout that very
period had, by degrees, lost all he loved on earth, and was now
existing apart from civilised society; and yet, during those
twenty years, where William knew one happy moment, Henry tasted
hundreds.</p>
<p>That the state of the mind, and not outward circumstances, is
the nice point on which happiness depends is but a trite remark;
but that intellectual power should have the force to render a man
discontented in extraordinary prosperity, such as that of the
present bishop, or contented in his brother&rsquo;s extreme of
adversity, requires illustration.</p>
<p>The first great affliction to Henry was his brother&rsquo;s
ingratitude; but reasoning on the frailty of man&rsquo;s nature,
and the force of man&rsquo;s temptations, he found excuses for
William, which made him support the treatment he had received
with more tranquillity than William&rsquo;s proud mind supported
his brother&rsquo;s marriage.</p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s indulgent disposition made him less angry with
William than William was with him.</p>
<p>The next affliction Henry suffered was the loss of his beloved
wife.&nbsp; That was a grief which time and change of objects
gradually alleviated; while William&rsquo;s wife was to him a
permanent grief, her puerile mind, her talking vanity, her
affected virtues, soured his domestic comfort, and, in time, he
had suffered more painful moments from her society than his
brother had experienced, even from the death of her he loved.</p>
<p>In their children, indeed, William was the happier; his son
was a pride and pleasure to him, while Henry never thought upon
<i>his</i> without lamenting his loss with bitterest
anguish.&nbsp; But if the elder brother had in one instance the
advantage, still Henry had a resource to overbalance this
article.&nbsp; Henry, as he lay imprisoned in his dungeon, and
when, his punishment being remitted, he was again allowed to
wander, and seek his subsistence where he would, in all his
tedious walks and solitary resting-places, during all his lonely
days and mournful nights, had <i>this resource</i> to console
him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did an injury to any one; never was harsh,
severe, unkind, deceitful.&nbsp; I did not merely confine myself
to do my neighbour no harm; I strove to do him
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the resource that cheered his sinking heart amidst
gloomy deserts and a barbarous people, lulled him to peaceful
slumber in the hut of a savage hunter, and in the hearing of the
lion&rsquo;s roar, at times impressed him with a sense of
happiness, and made him contemplate with a longing hope the
retribution of a future world.</p>
<p>The bishop, with all his comforts, had no comfort like this;
he had <i>his</i> solitary reflections too, but they were of a
tendency the reverse of these.&nbsp; &ldquo;I used my brother
ill,&rdquo; was a secret thought of most powerful
influence.&nbsp; It kept him waking upon his safe and commodious
bed; was sure to recur with every misfortune by which he was
threatened to make his fears still stronger, and came with
invidious stabs, upon every successful event, to take from him a
part of his joy.&nbsp; In a word, it was <i>conscience</i> which
made Henry&rsquo;s years pass happier than William&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>But though, comparatively with his brother, William was the
less happy man, yet his self-reproach was not of such magnitude,
for an offence of that atrocious nature as to banish from his
breast a certain degree of happiness, a sensibility to the smiles
of fortune; nor was Henry&rsquo;s self-acquittal of such
exquisite kind as to chase away the feeling of his desolate
condition.</p>
<p>As he fished or hunted for his daily dinner, many a time in
full view of his prey, a sudden burst of sorrow at his fate, a
sudden longing for some dear associate, for some friend to share
his thoughts, for some kind shoulder on which to lean his head,
for some companion to partake of his repast, would make him
instantaneously desist from his pursuit, cast him on the ground
in a fit of anguish, till a shower of tears and his
<i>conscience</i> came to his relief.</p>
<p>It was, after an exile of more than twenty-three years, when,
on one sultry morning, after pleasant dreams during the night,
Henry had waked with more than usual perception of his misery,
that, sitting upon the beach, his wishes and his looks all bent
on the sea towards his native land, he thought he saw a sail
swelling before an unexpected breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I am dreaming still!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is the very vessel I last night saw in my
sleep!&nbsp; Oh! what cruel mockery that my eyes should so
deceive me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, though he doubted, he leaped upon his feet in transport,
held up his hands, stretched at their length, in a kind of
ecstatic joy, and, as the glorious sight approached, was near
rushing into the sea to hail and meet it.</p>
<p>For awhile hope and fear kept him in a state bordering on
distraction.</p>
<p>Now he saw the ship making for the shore, and tears flowed for
the grateful prospect.&nbsp; Now it made for another point, and
he vented shrieks and groans from the disappointment.</p>
<p>It was at those moments, while hope and fear thus possessed
him, that the horrors of his abode appeared more than ever
frightful.&nbsp; Inevitable afflictions must be borne; but that
calamity which admits the expectation of relief, and then denies
it, is insupportable.</p>
<p>After a few minutes passed in dreadful uncertainty, which
enhanced the wished-for happiness, the ship evidently drew near
the land; a boat was launched from her, and while Henry, now upon
his knees, wept and prayed fervently for the event, a youth
sprang from the barge on the strand, rushed towards him, and
falling on his neck, then at his feet, exclaimed, &ldquo;My
father! oh, my father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>William! dean! bishop! what are your honours, what your
riches, what all your possessions, compared to the happiness, the
transport bestowed by this one sentence, on your poor brother
Henry?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<p>The crosses at land, and the perilous events at sea, had made
it now two years since young Henry first took the vow of a man no
longer dependent on the will of another, to seek his
father.&nbsp; His fatigues, his dangers, were well
recompensed.&nbsp; Instead of weeping over a silent grave, he had
the inexpressible joy to receive a parent&rsquo;s blessing for
his labours.&nbsp; Yet, the elder Henry, though living, was so
changed in person, that his son would scarcely have known him in
any other than the favourite spot, which the younger (keeping in
memory every incident of his former life) knew his father had
always chosen for his morning contemplations; and where,
previously to his coming to England, he had many a time kept him
company.&nbsp; It was to that particular corner of the island
that the captain of the ship had generously ordered they should
steer, out of the general route, to gratify the filial tenderness
he expressed.&nbsp; But scarcely had the interview between the
father and the son taken place, than a band of natives, whom the
appearance of the vessel had called from the woods and hills,
came to attack the invaders.&nbsp; The elder Henry had no friend
with whom he wished to shake hands at his departure; the old
negro servant who had assisted in young Henry&rsquo;s escape was
dead; and he experienced the excessive joy of bidding adieu to
the place, without one regret for all he left behind.</p>
<p>On the night of that day, whose morning had been marked by
peculiar sadness at the louring prospect of many exiled years to
come, he slept on board an English vessel, with Englishmen his
companions, and his son, his beloved son&mdash;who was still more
dear to him for that mind which had planned and executed his
rescue&mdash;this son, his attentive servant, and most
affectionate friend.</p>
<p>Though many a year passed, and many a rough encounter was
destined to the lot of the two Henrys before they saw the shores
of Europe, yet to them, to live or to die together was happiness
enough: even young Henry for a time asked for no greater
blessing&mdash;but, the first glow of filial ardour over, he
called to mind, &ldquo;Rebecca lived in England;&rdquo; and every
exertion which love, founded on the highest reverence and esteem,
could dictate, he employed to expedite a voyage, the end of which
would be crowned by the sight of her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<p>The contrast of the state of happiness between the two
brothers was nearly resembled by that of the two
cousins&mdash;the riches of young William did not render him
happy, nor did the poverty of young Henry doom him to
misery.&nbsp; His affectionate heart, as he had described in his
letter to Rebecca, loved <i>persons</i> rather than
<i>things</i>; and he would not have exchanged the society of his
father, nor the prospect of her hand and heart, for all the
wealth and splendour of which his cousin William was the
master.</p>
<p>He was right.&nbsp; Young William, though he viewed with
contempt Henry&rsquo;s inferior state, was far less happy than
he.&nbsp; His marriage had been the very counterpart of his
father&rsquo;s; and having no child to create affection to his
home, his study was the only relief from that domestic
incumbrance called his wife; and though, by unremitting
application there (joined to the influence of the potent
relations of the woman he hated), he at length arrived at the
summit of his ambitious desires, still they poorly repaid him for
the sacrifice he had made in early life of every tender
disposition.</p>
<p>Striding through a list of rapid advancements in the
profession of the law, at the age of thirty-eight he found
himself raised to a preferment such as rarely falls to the share
of a man of his short experience&mdash;he found himself invested
with a judge&rsquo;s robe; and, gratified by the exalted office,
curbed more than ever that aversion which her want of charms or
sympathy had produced against the partner of his honours.</p>
<p>While William had thus been daily rising in fortune&rsquo;s
favour, poor Agnes had been daily sinking deeper and deeper under
fortune&rsquo;s frowns: till at last she became a midnight
wanderer through the streets of London, soliciting, or rudely
demanding, money of the passing stranger.&nbsp; Sometimes, hunted
by the watch, she affrighted fled from street to street, from
portico to portico; and once, unknowing in her fear which way she
hurried, she found her trembling knees had sunk, and her wearied
head was reclined against the stately pillars that guarded
William&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>At the sudden recollection where she was, a swell of passion,
composed of horror, of anger, of despair, and love, gave
reanimated strength to her failing limbs; and, regardless of her
pursuer&rsquo;s steps, she ran to the centre of the street, and,
looking up to the windows of the mansion, cried, &ldquo;Ah! there
he sleeps in quiet, in peace, in ease&mdash;he does not even
dream of me&mdash;he does not care how the cold pierces, or how
the people persecute me!&nbsp; He does not thank me for all the
lavish love I have borne him and his child!&nbsp; His heart is so
hard, he does not even recollect that it was he who brought me to
ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had these miseries, common to the unhappy prostitute, been
alone the punishment of Agnes&mdash;had her crimes and sufferings
ended in distress like this, her story had not perhaps been
selected for a public recital; for it had been no other than the
customary history of thousands of her sex.&nbsp; But Agnes had a
destiny yet more fatal.&nbsp; Unhappily, she was endowed with a
mind so sensibly alive to every joy, and every sorrow, to every
mark of kindness, every token of severity, so liable to excess in
passion, that, once perverted, there was no degree of error from
which it would revolt.</p>
<p>Taught by the conversation of the dissolute poor, with whom
she now associated, or by her own observation on the worldly
reward of elevated villainy, she began to suspect &ldquo;that
dishonesty was only held a sin to secure the property of the
rich; and that, to take from those who did not want, by the art
of stealing, was less guilt, than to take from those who did
want, by the power of the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By false yet seducing opinions such as these, her reason
estranged from every moral and religious tie, her necessities
urgent, she reluctantly accepted the proposal to mix with a band
of practised sharpers and robbers, and became an accomplice in
negotiating bills forged on a country banker.</p>
<p>But though ingenious in arguments to excuse the deed before
its commission, in the act she had ever the dread of some
incontrovertible statement on the other side of the
question.&nbsp; Intimidated by this apprehension, she was the
veriest bungler in her vile profession&mdash;and on the alarm of
being detected, while every one of her confederates escaped and
absconded, she alone was seized&mdash;was arrested for issuing
notes they had fabricated, and committed to the provincial jail,
about fifty miles from London, where the crime had been
perpetrated, to take her trial for&mdash;life or death.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
<p>The day at length is come on which Agnes shall have a sight of
her beloved William!&nbsp; She who has watched for hours near his
door, to procure a glimpse of him going out, or returning home;
who has walked miles to see his chariot pass: she now will behold
him, and he will see her by command of the laws of their
country.&nbsp; Those laws, which will deal with rigour towards
her, are in this one instance still indulgent.</p>
<p>The time of the assizes, at the county town in which she is
imprisoned, is arrived&mdash;the prisoners are demanded at the
shire-hall&mdash;the jail doors are opened&mdash;they go in sad
procession&mdash;the trumpet sounds&mdash;it speaks the arrival
of the judge&mdash;and that judge is William!</p>
<p>The day previous to her trial, Agnes had read, in the printed
calendar of the prisoners, his name as the learned justice before
whom she was to appear.&nbsp; For a moment she forgot her
perilous state in the excess of joy which the still unconquerable
love she bore to him permitted her to taste even on the brink of
the grave!&nbsp; After-reflection made her check those worldly
transports, as unfit for the present solemn occasion.&nbsp; But
alas! to her, earth and William were so closely united that, till
she forsook the one, she could never cease to think, without the
contending passions of hope, of fear, of joy, of love, of shame,
and of despair, on the other.</p>
<p>Now fear took place of her first immoderate joy&mdash;she
feared that, although much changed in person since he had seen
her, and her real name now added to many an
<i>alias</i>&mdash;yet she feared that same well-known glance of
the eye, turn of the action, or accent of speech, might recall
her to his remembrance; and at that idea shame overcame all her
other sensations&mdash;for still she retained pride, in respect
to <i>his</i> opinion, to wish him not to know Agnes was that
wretch she felt she was!&nbsp; Once a ray of hope beamed on her,
&ldquo;that if he knew her, he recognised her, he might possibly
befriend her cause;&rdquo; and life bestowed through
William&rsquo;s friendship seemed a precious object!&nbsp; But
again, that rigorous honour she had often heard him boast, that
firmness to his word, of which she had fatal experience, taught
her to know, he would not for any unproper compassion, any
unmanly weakness, forfeit his oath of impartial justice.</p>
<p>In meditations such as these she passed the sleepless
night.&nbsp; When, in the morning, she was brought to the bar,
and her guilty hand held up before the righteous judgment seat of
William&mdash;imagination could not form two figures, or two
situations more incompatible with the existence of former
familiarity, than the judge and the culprit&mdash;and yet, these
very persons had passed together the most blissful moments that
either ever tasted!&nbsp; Those hours of tender dalliance were
now present to <i>her</i> mind.&nbsp; <i>His</i> thoughts were
more nobly employed in his high office; nor could the haggard
face, hollow eye, desponding countenance, and meagre person of
the poor prisoner, once call to his memory, though her name was
uttered among a list of others which she had assumed, his former
youthful, lovely Agnes!</p>
<p>She heard herself arraigned with trembling limbs and downcast
looks; and many witnesses had appeared against her before she
ventured to lift her eyes up to her awful judge.&nbsp; She then
gave one fearful glance, and discovered William, unpitying but
beloved William, in every feature!&nbsp; It was a face she had
been used to look on with delight, and a kind of absent smile of
gladness now beamed on her poor wan visage.</p>
<p>When every witness on the part of the prosecutor had been
examined, the judge addressed himself to her&mdash;&ldquo;What
defence have you to make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was William spoke to Agnes!&nbsp; The sound was sweet; the
voice was mild, was soft, compassionate, encouraging!&nbsp; It
almost charmed her to a love of life!&mdash;not such a voice as
when William last addressed her; when he left her undone and
pregnant, vowing never to see or speak to her more.</p>
<p>She could have hung upon the present words for ever!&nbsp; She
did not call to mind that this gentleness was the effect of
practice, the art of his occupation: which, at times, is but a
copy, by the unfeeling, from his benevolent brethren of the
bench.&nbsp; In the present judge, tenderness was not designed
for the consolation of the culprit, but for the approbation of
the auditors.</p>
<p>There were no spectators, Agnes, by your side when last he
parted from you: if there had, the awful William had been awed to
marks of pity.</p>
<p>Stunned with the enchantment of that well-known tongue
directed to her, she stood like one just petrified&mdash;all
vital power seemed suspended.</p>
<p>Again he put the question, and with these additional
sentences, tenderly and emphatically
delivered&mdash;&ldquo;Recollect yourself.&nbsp; Have you no
witnesses?&nbsp; No proof in your behalf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dead silence followed these questions.</p>
<p>He then mildly, but forcibly, added&mdash;&ldquo;What have you
to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here a flood of tears burst from her eyes, which she fixed
earnestly upon him, as if pleading for mercy, while she faintly
articulated,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a short pause, he asked her, in the same forcible but
benevolent tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no one to speak to your
character?&rdquo;&nbsp; The prisoner answered&mdash;</p>
<p>A second gush of tears followed this reply, for she called to
mind by <i>whom</i> her character had first been blasted.</p>
<p>He summed up the evidence; and every time he was compelled to
press hard upon the proofs against her she shrunk, and seemed to
stagger with the deadly blow; writhed under the weight of
<i>his</i> minute justice, more than from the prospect of a
shameful death.</p>
<p>The jury consulted but a few minutes.&nbsp; The verdict
was&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She heard it with composure.</p>
<p>But when William placed the fatal velvet on his head, and rose
to pronounce her sentence, she started with a kind of convulsive
motion; retreated a step or two back, and, lifting up her hands,
with a scream exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! not from <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The piercing shriek which accompanied these words prevented
their being heard by part of the audience; and those who heard
them thought little of their meaning, more than that they
expressed her fear of dying.</p>
<p>Serene and dignified, as if no such exclamation had been
uttered, William delivered the fatal speech, ending with,
&ldquo;Dead, dead, dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fainted as he closed the period, and was carried back to
prison in a swoon; while he adjourned the court to go to
dinner.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
<p>If, unaffected by the scene he had witnessed, William sat down
to dinner with an appetite, let not the reader conceive that the
most distant suspicion had struck his mind of his ever having
seen, much less familiarly known, the poor offender whom he had
just condemned.&nbsp; Still this forgetfulness did not proceed
from the want of memory for Agnes.&nbsp; In every peevish or
heavy hour passed with his wife, he was sure to think of her: yet
it was self-love, rather than love of <i>her</i>, that gave rise
to these thoughts: he felt the lack of female sympathy and
tenderness to soften the fatigue of studious labour; to sooth a
sullen, a morose disposition&mdash;he felt he wanted comfort for
himself, but never once considered what were the wants of
Agnes.</p>
<p>In the chagrin of a barren bed, he sometimes thought, too,
even on the child that Agnes bore him; but whether it were male
or female, whether a beggar in the streets, or dead&mdash;various
and important public occupations forbade him to waste time to
inquire.&nbsp; Yet the poor, the widow, and the orphan,
frequently shared William&rsquo;s ostentatious bounty.&nbsp; He
was the president of many excellent charities, gave largely, and
sometimes instituted benevolent societies for the unhappy; for he
delighted to load the poor with obligations, and the rich with
praise.</p>
<p>There are persons like him, who love to do every good but that
which their immediate duty requires.&nbsp; There are servants who
will serve every one more cheerfully than their masters; there
are men who will distribute money liberally to all except their
creditors; and there are wives who will love all mankind better
than their husbands.&nbsp; Duty is a familiar word which has
little effect upon an ordinary mind; and as ordinary minds make a
vast majority, we have acts of generosity, valour, self-denial,
and bounty, where smaller pains would constitute greater
virtues.&nbsp; Had William followed the <i>common</i> dictates of
charity; had he adopted private pity, instead of public
munificence; had he cast an eye at home before he sought abroad
for objects of compassion, Agnes had been preserved from an
ignominious death, and he had been preserved
from&mdash;<i>Remorse</i>&mdash;the tortures of which he for the
first time proved, on reading a printed sheet of paper,
accidentally thrown in his way, a few days after he had left the
town in which he had condemned her to die.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>March the</i>
12th, 179-</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last dying words, speech, and confession; birth,
parentage, and education; life, character, and behaviour, of
Agnes Primrose, who was executed this morning, between the hours
of ten and twelve, pursuant to the sentence passed upon her by
the Honourable Justice Norwynne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AGNES PRIMROSE was born of honest parents, in the
village of Anfield, in the county of ---&rdquo;&nbsp; [William
started at the name of the village and county]; &ldquo;but being
led astray by the arts and flattery of seducing man, she fell
from the paths of virtue, and took to bad company, which
instilled into her young heart all their evil ways, and at length
brought her to this untimely end.&nbsp; So she hopes her death
will be a warning to all young persons of her own sex, how they
listen to the praises and courtship of young men, especially of
those who are their betters; for they only court to
deceive.&nbsp; But the said Agnes freely forgives all persons who
have done her injury, or given her sorrow, from the young man who
first won her heart to the jury who found her guilty, and the
judge who condemned her to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she acknowledges the justice of her sentence, not
only in respect of the crime for which she suffers, but in regard
to many other heinous sins of which she has been guilty, more
especially that of once attempting to commit a murder upon her
own helpless child, for which guilt she now considers the
vengeance of God has overtaken her, to which she is patiently
resigned, and departs in peace and charity with all the world,
praying the Lord to have mercy on her parting soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;POSTSCRIPT TO THE
CONFESSION.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So great was this unhappy woman&rsquo;s terror of
death, and the awful judgment that was to follow, that when
sentence was pronounced upon her, she fell into a swoon, from
that into convulsions, from which she never entirely recovered,
but was delirious to the time of her execution, except that short
interval in which she made her confession to the clergyman who
attended her.&nbsp; She has left one child, a youth about
sixteen, who has never forsaken his mother during all the time of
her imprisonment, but waited on her with true filial duty; and no
sooner was her fatal sentence passed than he began to droop, and
now lies dangerously ill near the prison from which she is
released by death.&nbsp; During the loss of her senses, the said
Agnes Primrose raved continually on this child; and, asking for
pen, ink, and paper, wrote an incoherent petition to the judge
recommending the youth to his protection and mercy.&nbsp; But
notwithstanding this insanity, she behaved with composure and
resignation when the fatal morning arrived in which she was to be
launched into eternity.&nbsp; She prayed devoutly during the last
hour, and seemed to have her whole mind fixed on the world to
which she was going.&nbsp; A crowd of spectators followed her to
the fatal spot, most of whom returned weeping at the recollection
of the fervency with which she prayed, and the impression which
her dreadful state seemed to make upon her.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No sooner had the name of &ldquo;Anfield&rdquo; struck William
than a thousand reflections and remembrances flashed on his mind
to give him full conviction whom it was he had judged and
sentenced.&nbsp; He recollected the sad remains of Agnes, such as
he once had known her; and now he wondered how his thoughts could
have been absent from an object so pitiable, so worthy of his
attention, as not to give him even a suspicion who she was,
either from her name, or from her person, during the whole
trial!</p>
<p>But wonder, astonishment, horror, and every other sensation
was absorbed by&mdash;<i>Remorse</i>:&mdash;it wounded, it
stabbed, it rent his hard heart, as it would do a tender
one.&nbsp; It havocked on his firm inflexible mind, as it would
on a weak and pliant brain!&nbsp; Spirit of Agnes! look down, and
behold all your wrongs revenged!&nbsp; William
feels&mdash;<i>Remorse</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
<p>A few momentary cessations from the pangs of a guilty
conscience were given to William, as soon as he had despatched a
messenger to the jail in which Agnes had been communed, to
inquire after the son she had left behind, and to give orders
that immediate care should be taken of him.&nbsp; He likewise
charged the messenger to bring back the petition she had
addressed to him during her supposed insanity; for he now
experienced no trivial consolation in the thought that he might
possibly have it in his power to grant her a request.</p>
<p>The messenger returned with the written paper, which had been
considered by the persons to whom she had intrusted it, as the
distracted dictates of an insane mind; but proved to William,
beyond a doubt, that she was perfectly in her senses.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;TO LORD CHIEF
JUSTICE NORWYNNE.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I am Agnes
Primrose, the daughter of John and Hannah Primrose, of
Anfield.&nbsp; My father and mother lived by the hill at the side
of the little brook where you used to fish, and so first saw
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, my lord, have mercy on my sorrows; pity me for
the first time, and spare my life.&nbsp; I know I have done
wrong.&nbsp; I know it is presumption in me to dare to apply to
you, such a wicked and mean wretch as I am; but, my lord, you
once condescended to take notice of me; and though I have been
very wicked since that time, yet if you would be so merciful as
to spare my life, I promise to amend it for the future.&nbsp; But
if you think it proper I should die, I will be resigned; but then
I hope, I beg, I supplicate, that you will grant my other
petition.&nbsp; Pray, pray, my lord, if you cannot pardon me, be
merciful to the child I leave behind.&nbsp; What he will do when
I am gone, I don&rsquo;t know, for I have been the only friend he
has had ever since he was born.&nbsp; He was born, my lord, about
sixteen years ago, at Anfield, one summer a morning, and carried
by your cousin, Mr. Henry Norwynne, to Mr. Rymer&rsquo;s, the
curate there; and I swore whose child he was before the dean, and
I did not take a false oath.&nbsp; Indeed, indeed, my lord, I did
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say no more for fear this should not come safe
to your hand, for the people treat me as if I were mad; so I will
say no more, only this, that, whether I live or die, I forgive
everybody, and I hope everybody will forgive me.&nbsp; And I pray
that God will take pity on my son, if you refuse; but I hope you
will not refuse.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Agnes
Primrose</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William rejoiced, as he laid down the petition, that she had
asked a favour he could bestow; and hoped by his protection of
the son to redress, in some degree, the wrongs he had done the
mother.&nbsp; He instantly sent for the messenger into his
apartment, and impatiently asked, &ldquo;If he had seen the boy,
and given proper directions for his care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given directions, sir, for his
funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; cried William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He pined away ever since his mother was confined, and
died two days after her execution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robbed, by this news, of his only gleam of
consolation&mdash;in the consciousness of having done a mortal
injury for which he never now by any means could atone, he saw
all his honours, all his riches, all his proud selfish triumphs
fade before him!&nbsp; They seemed like airy nothings, which in
rapture he would exchange for the peace of a tranquil
conscience!</p>
<p>He envied Agnes the death to which he first exposed, then
condemned, her.&nbsp; He envied her even the life she struggled
through from his neglect, and felt that his future days would be
far less happy than her former existence.&nbsp; He calculated
with precision.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<p>The progressive rise of William and fall of Agnes had now
occupied nearly the term of eighteen years.&nbsp; Added to these,
another year elapsed before the younger Henry completed the
errand on which his heart was fixed, and returned to
England.&nbsp; Shipwreck, imprisonment, and other ills to which
the poor and unfriended traveller is peculiarly exposed, detained
the father and son in various remote regions until the present
period; and, for the last fifteen years, denied them the means of
all correspondence with their own country.</p>
<p>The elder Henry was now past sixty years of age, and the
younger almost beyond the prime of life.&nbsp; Still length of
time had not diminished, but rather had increased, their anxious
longings for their native home.</p>
<p>The sorrows, disappointments, and fatigues, which, throughout
these tedious years, were endured by the two Henrys, are of that
dull monotonous kind of suffering better omitted than
described&mdash;mere repetitions of the exile&rsquo;s woe, that
shall give place to the transporting joy of return from
banishment!&nbsp; Yet, often as the younger had reckoned, with
impatient wishes, the hours which were passed distant from her he
loved, no sooner was his disastrous voyage at an end, no sooner
had his feet trod upon the shore of Britain, than a thousand
wounding fears made him almost doubt whether it were happiness or
misery he had obtained by his arrival.&nbsp; If Rebecca were
living, he knew it must be happiness; for his heart dwelt with
confidence on her faith, her unchanging sentiments.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But death might possibly have ravished from his hopes what
no mortal power could have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thus the lover
creates a rival in every ill, rather than suffer his fears to
remain inanimate.</p>
<p>The elder Henry had less to fear or to hope than his son; yet
he both feared and hoped with a sensibility that gave him great
anxiety.&nbsp; He hoped his brother would receive him with
kindness, after his long absence, and once more take his son
cordially to his favour.&nbsp; He longed impatiently to behold
his brother; to see his nephew; nay, in the ardour of the renewed
affection he just now felt, he thought even a distant view of
Lady Clementina would be grateful to his sight!&nbsp; But still,
well remembering the pomp, the state, the pride of William, he
could not rely on <i>his</i> affection, so much he knew that it
depended on external circumstances to excite or to extinguish his
love.&nbsp; Not that he feared an absolute repulsion from his
brother; but he feared, what, to a delicate mind, is still
worse&mdash;reserved manners, cold looks, absent sentences, and
all that cruel retinue of indifference with which those who are
beloved so often wound the bosom that adores them.</p>
<p>By inquiring of their countrymen (whom they met as they
approached to the end of their voyage), concerning their relation
the dean, the two Henrys learned that he was well, and had for
some years past been exalted to the bishopric of ---.&nbsp; This
news gave them joy, while it increased their fear of not
receiving an affectionate welcome.</p>
<p>The younger Henry, on his landing, wrote immediately to his
uncle, acquainting him with his father&rsquo;s arrival in the
most abject state of poverty; he addressed his letter to the
bishop&rsquo;s country residence, where he knew, as it was the
summer season, he would certainly be.&nbsp; He and his father
then set off on foot towards that residence&mdash;a palace!</p>
<p>The bishop&rsquo;s palace was not situated above fifty miles
from the port where they had landed; and at a small inn about
three miles from the bishop&rsquo;s they proposed (as the letter
to him intimated) to wait for his answer before they intruded
into his presence.</p>
<p>As they walked on their solitary journey, it was some small
consolation that no creature knew them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be poor and ragged, father,&rdquo; the younger
smilingly said, &ldquo;is no disgrace, no shame, thank Heaven,
where the object is not known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, my son,&rdquo; replied Henry; &ldquo;and perhaps
I feel myself much happier now, unknowing and unknown to all but
you, than I shall in the presence of my fortunate brother and his
family; for there, confusion at my ill success through life may
give me greater pain than even my misfortunes have
inflicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After uttering this reflection which had preyed upon his mind,
he sat down on the road side to rest his agitated limbs before he
could proceed farther.&nbsp; His son reasoned with him&mdash;gave
him courage; and now his hopes preponderated, till, after two
days&rsquo; journey, on arriving at the inn where an answer from
the bishop was expected, no letter, no message had been left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means to renounce us,&rdquo; said Henry, trembling,
and whispering to his son.</p>
<p>Without disclosing to the people of the house who they were,
or from whom the letter or the message they inquired for was to
have come, they retired, and consulted what steps they were now
to pursue.</p>
<p>Previously to his writing to the bishop, the younger
Henry&rsquo;s heart, all his inclinations, had swayed him towards
a visit to the village in which was his uncle&rsquo;s former
country-seat, the beloved village of Anfield, but respect to him
and duty to his father had made him check those wishes; now they
revived again, and, with the image of Rebecca before his eyes, he
warmly entreated his father to go with him to Anfield, at present
only thirty miles distant, and thence write once more; then again
wait the will of his uncle.</p>
<p>The father consented to this proposal, even glad to postpone
the visit to his dignified brother.</p>
<p>After a scanty repast, such as they had been long inured to,
they quitted the inn, and took the road towards Anfield.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
<p>It was about five in the afternoon of a summer&rsquo;s day,
that Henry and his son left the sign of the Mermaid to pursue
their third day&rsquo;s journey: the young man&rsquo;s spirits
elated with the prospect of the reception he should meet from
Rebecca: the elder dejected at not having received a speedy
welcome from his brother.</p>
<p>The road which led to Anfield by the shortest course of
necessity took our travellers within sight of the bishop&rsquo;s
palace.&nbsp; The turrets appeared at a distance; and on the
sudden turn round the corner of a large plantation, the whole
magnificent structure was at once exhibited before his
brother&rsquo;s astonished eyes.&nbsp; He was struck with the
grandeur of the habitation; and, totally forgetting all the
unkind, the contemptuous treatment he had ever received from its
owner (like the same Henry in his earlier years), smiled with a
kind of transport &ldquo;that William was so great a
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this first joyous sensation was over, &ldquo;Let us go a
little nearer, my son,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;no one will see us,
I hope; or, if they should, you can run and conceal yourself; and
not a creature will know me; even my brother would not know me
thus altered; and I wish to take a little farther view of his
fine house, and all his pleasure grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Henry, though impatient to be gone, would not object to
his father&rsquo;s desire.&nbsp; They walked forward between a
shady grove and a purling rivulet, snuffed in odours from the
jessamine banks, and listened to the melody of an adjoining
aviary.</p>
<p>The allurements of the spot seemed to enchain the elder Henry,
and he at length sauntered to the very avenue of the dwelling;
but, just as he had set his daring yet trembling feet upon the
turf which led to the palace gates, he suddenly stopped, on
hearing, as he thought, the village clock strike seven, which
reminded him that evening drew on, and it was time to go.&nbsp;
He listened again, when he and his son, both together, said,
&ldquo;It is the toll of the bell before some funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The signals of death, while they humble the rich, inspire the
poor with pride.&nbsp; The passing bell gave Henry a momentary
sense of equality; and he courageously stepped forward to the
first winding of the avenue.</p>
<p>He started back at the sight which presented itself.</p>
<p>A hearse&mdash;mourning coaches&mdash;mutes&mdash;plumed
horses&mdash;with every other token of the person&rsquo;s
importance who was going to be committed to the earth.</p>
<p>Scarcely had his terrified eyes been thus unexpectedly struck,
when a coffin borne by six men issued from the gates, and was
deposited in the waiting receptacle; while gentlemen in mourning
went into the different coaches.</p>
<p>A standard-bearer now appeared with an escutcheon, on which
the keys and mitre were displayed.&nbsp; Young Henry, upon this,
pathetically exclaimed, &ldquo;My uncle! it is my uncle&rsquo;s
funeral!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry, his father, burst into tears.</p>
<p>The procession moved along.</p>
<p>The two Henrys, the only real mourners in the train, followed
at a little distance&mdash;in rags, but in tears.</p>
<p>The elder Henry&rsquo;s heart was nearly bursting; he longed
to clasp the dear remains of his brother without the dread of
being spurned for his presumption.&nbsp; He now could no longer
remember him either as the dean or bishop; but, leaping over that
whole interval of pride and arrogance, called only to his memory
William, such as he knew him when they lived at home together,
together walked to London, and there together almost perished for
want.</p>
<p>They arrived at the church; and, while the coffin was placing
in the dreary vault, the weeping brother crept slowly after to
the hideous spot.&nbsp; His reflections now fixed on a different
point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this possible?&rdquo; said he to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this the dean, whom I ever feared?&nbsp;
Is this the bishop, of whom within the present hour I stood in
awe?&nbsp; Is this William, whose every glance struck me with his
superiority?&nbsp; Alas, my brother! and is this horrid abode the
reward for all your aspiring efforts?&nbsp; Are these sepulchral
trappings the only testimonies of your greatness which you
exhibit to me on my return?&nbsp; Did you foresee an end like
this, while you treated me, and many more of your youthful
companions, with haughtiness and contempt; while you thought it
becoming of your dignity to shun and despise us?&nbsp; Where is
the difference now between my departed wife and you?&nbsp; Or, if
there be a difference, she, perchance, has the advantage.&nbsp;
Ah, my poor brother! for distinction in the other world, I trust,
some of your anxious labours have been employed; for you are now
of less importance in this than when you and I first left our
native town, and hoped for nothing greater than to be suffered to
exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On their quitting the church, they inquired of the bystanders
the immediate cause of the bishop&rsquo;s death, and heard he had
been suddenly carried off by a raging fever.</p>
<p>Young Henry inquired &ldquo;if Lady Clementina was at the
palace, or Mr. Norwynne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latter is there,&rdquo; he was answered by a poor
woman; &ldquo;but Lady Clementina has been dead these four
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! dead!&rdquo; cried young Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
worldly woman! quitted this world for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the stranger; &ldquo;she caught
cold by wearing a new-fashioned dress that did not half cover
her, wasted all away, and died the miserablest object you ever
heard of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person who gave this melancholy intelligence concluded it
with a hearty laugh, which would have surprised the two hearers
if they had not before observed that amongst all the village
crowd that attended to see this solemn show not one afflicted
countenance appeared, not one dejected look, not one watery
eye.&nbsp; The pastor was scarcely known to his flock; it was in
London that his meridian lay, at the lev&eacute;e of ministers,
at the table of peers, at the drawing-rooms of the great; and now
his neglected parishioners paid his indifference in kind.</p>
<p>The ceremony over, and the mourning suite departed, the
spectators dispersed with gibes and jeering faces from the sad
spot; while the Henrys, with heavy hearts, retraced their steps
back towards the palace.&nbsp; In their way, at the crossing of a
stile, they met a poor labourer returning from his day&rsquo;s
work, who, looking earnestly at the throng of persons who were
leaving the churchyard, said to the elder
Henry&mdash;&ldquo;Pray, master, what are all them folk gathered
together about?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the matter there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been a funeral,&rdquo; replied Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, zooks! what! a burying!&mdash;ay, now I see it is;
and I warrant of our old bishop&mdash;I heard he was main
ill.&nbsp; It is he they have been putting into the ground! is
not it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, so much the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The better!&rdquo; cried Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, master; though I should be loth to be where he is
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry started&mdash;&ldquo;He was your pastor, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; I should be sorry that my
master&rsquo;s sheep, that are feeding yonder, should have no
better pastor&mdash;the fox would soon get them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely did not know him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, I can&rsquo;t say I did; for he was above
speaking to poor folks, unless they did any mischief&mdash;and
then he was sure to take notice of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he meant well,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to what he meant, God only knows; but I know what he
<i>did</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all for the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of them applied to him, no
doubt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! they knew better than all that comes to; for if
they asked for anything, he was sure to have them sent to
Bridewell, or the workhouse.&nbsp; He used to say, &lsquo;<i>The
workhouse was a fine place for a poor man</i>&mdash;<i>the food
good enough</i>, <i>and enough of it</i>;&rsquo; yet he kept a
dainty table himself.&nbsp; His dogs, too, fared better than we
poor.&nbsp; He was vastly tender and good to all his horses and
dogs, I <i>will</i> say that for him; and to all brute beasts: he
would not suffer them to be either starved or struck&mdash;but he
had no compassion for his fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sensible you do him wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That <i>he</i> is the best judge of by this time.&nbsp;
He has sent many a poor man to the house of correction; and now
&rsquo;tis well if he has not got a place there himself.&nbsp;
Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was walking away, when Henry called to
him&mdash;&ldquo;Pray can you tell me if the bishop&rsquo;s son
be at the palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! you&rsquo;ll find master there treading in the
old man&rsquo;s shoes, as proud as Lucifer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he any children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank God!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been enow of the
name; and after the son is gone, I hope we shall have no more of
the breed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Norwynne, the son&rsquo;s wife, at the
palace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, master! did not you know what&rsquo;s become of
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any accident?&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! yes.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help
laughing&mdash;why, master, she made a mistake, and went to
another man&rsquo;s bed&mdash;and so her husband and she were
parted&mdash;and she has married the other man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried Henry, amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, indeed; but if it had been my wife or yours, the
bishop would have made her do penance in a white sheet; but as it
was a lady, why, it was all very well&mdash;and any one of us,
that had been known to talk about it, would have been sent to
Bridewell straight.&nbsp; But we <i>did</i> talk,
notwithstanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The malicious joy with which the peasant told this story made
Henry believe (more than all the complaints the man uttered) that
there had been want of charity and Christian deportment in the
whole conduct of the bishop&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; He almost
wished himself back on his savage island, where brotherly love
could not be less than it appeared to be in this civilised
country.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
<p>As Henry and his son, after parting from the poor labourer,
approached the late bishop&rsquo;s palace, all the charms of its
magnificence, its situation, which, but a few hours before, had
captivated the elder Henry&rsquo;s mind, were vanished; and, from
the mournful ceremony he had since been witness of, he now viewed
this noble edifice but as a heap of rubbish piled together to
fascinate weak understandings, and to make even the wise and
religious man, at times, forget why he was sent into this
world.</p>
<p>Instead of presenting themselves to their nephew and cousin,
they both felt an unconquerable reluctance to enter under the
superb, the melancholy, roof.&nbsp; A bank, a hedge, a tree, a
hill, seemed, at this juncture, a pleasanter shelter, and each
felt himself happy in being a harmless wanderer on the face of
the earth rather than living in splendour, while the wants, the
revilings of the hungry and the naked were crying to Heaven for
vengeance.</p>
<p>They gave a heartfelt sigh to the vanity of the rich and the
powerful; and pursued a path where they hoped to meet with virtue
and happiness.</p>
<p>They arrived at Anfield.</p>
<p>Possessed by apprehensions, which his uncle&rsquo;s funeral
had served to increase, young Henry, as he entered the well-known
village, feared every sound he heard would convey information of
Rebecca&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; He saw the parsonage house at a
distance, but dreaded to approach it, lest Rebecca should no
longer be an inhabitant.&nbsp; His father indulged him in the
wish to take a short survey of the village, and rather learn by
indirect means, by observation, his fate, than hear it all at
once from the lips of some blunt relater.</p>
<p>Anfield had undergone great changes since Henry left it.&nbsp;
He found some cottages built where formerly there were none; and
some were no more where he had frequently called, and held short
conversations with the poor who dwelt in them.&nbsp; Amongst the
latter number was the house of the parents of Agnes&mdash;fallen
to the ground!&nbsp; He wondered to himself where that poor
family had taken up their abode.&nbsp; Henry, in a kinder
world!</p>
<p>He once again cast a look at the old parsonage house: his
inquisitive eye informed him there no alteration had taken place
externally; but he feared what change might be within.</p>
<p>At length he obtained the courage to enter the churchyard in
his way to it.&nbsp; As he slowly and tremblingly moved along, he
stopped to read here and there a gravestone; as mild, instructive
conveyers of intelligence, to which he could attend with more
resignation, than to any other reporter.</p>
<p>The second stone he came to he found was erected <i>To the
memory of the Reverend Thomas Rymer</i>, Rebecca&rsquo;s
father.&nbsp; He instantly called to mind all that poor
curate&rsquo;s quick sensibility of wrong towards <i>himself</i>;
his unbridled rage in consequence; and smiled to think; how
trivial now appeared all for which he gave way to such excess of
passion!</p>
<p>But, shocked at the death of one so near to her he loved, he
now feared to read on; and cast his eyes from the tombs
accidentally to the church.&nbsp; Through the window of the
chancel, his sight was struck with a tall monument of large
dimensions, raised since his departure, and adorned with the
finest sculpture.&nbsp; His curiosity was excited&mdash;he drew
near, and he could distinguish (followed by elegant poetic
praise) &ldquo;<i>To the memory of John Lord Viscount
Bendham</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the solemn, melancholy, anxious bent of
Henry&rsquo;s mind, he could not read these words, and behold
this costly fabric, without indulging a momentary fit of
indignant laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are sculpture and poetry thus debased,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;to perpetuate the memory of a man whose best advantage is
to be forgotten; whose no one action merits record, but as an
example to be shunned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An elderly woman, leaning on her staff, now passed along the
lane by the side of the church.&nbsp; The younger Henry accosted
her, and ventured to inquire &ldquo;where the daughters of Mr.
Rymer, since his death, were gone to live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We live,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;in that small
cottage across the clover field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry looked again, and thought he had mistaken the word
<i>we</i>; for he felt assured that he had no knowledge of the
person to whom he spoke.</p>
<p>But she knew him, and, after a pause,
cried&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Mr. Henry, you are welcome
back.&nbsp; I am heartily glad to see you, and my poor sister
Rebecca will go out of her wits with joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Rebecca living, and will be glad to see me?&rdquo;
he eagerly asked, while tears of rapture trickled down his
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he continued in his ecstasy,
&ldquo;we are now come home to be completely happy; and I feel as
if all the years I have been away were but a short week; and as
if all the dangers I have passed had been light as air.&nbsp; But
is it possible,&rdquo; he cried to his kind informer, &ldquo;that
you are one of Rebecca&rsquo;s sisters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well might he ask; for, instead of the blooming woman of
seven-and-twenty he had left her, her colour was gone, her teeth
impaired, her voice broken.&nbsp; She was near fifty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am one of Mr. Rymer&rsquo;s daughters,&rdquo;
she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which?&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eldest, and once called the prettiest,&rdquo; she
returned: &ldquo;though now people tell me I am altered; yet I
cannot say I see it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you all living?&rdquo; Henry inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but one: she married and died.&nbsp; The other
three, on my father&rsquo;s death, agreed to live together, and
knit or spin for our support.&nbsp; So we took that small
cottage, and furnished it with some of the parsonage furniture,
as you shall see; and kindly welcome I am sure you will be to all
it affords, though that is but little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she was saying this, she led him through the clover field
towards the cottage.&nbsp; His heart rebounded with joy that
Rebecca was there: yet, as he walked he shuddered at the
impression which he feared the first sight of her would
make.&nbsp; He feared, what he imagined (till he had seen this
change in her sister) he should never heed.&nbsp; He feared
Rebecca would look no longer young.&nbsp; He was not yet so far
master over all his sensual propensities as, when the trial came,
to think he could behold her look like her sister, and not give
some evidence of his disappointment.</p>
<p>His fears were vain.&nbsp; On entering the gate of their
little garden, Rebecca rushed from the house to meet them: just
the same Rebecca as ever.</p>
<p>It was her mind, which beaming on her face, and actuating her
every motion, had ever constituted all her charms: it was her
mind which had gained her Henry&rsquo;s affection.&nbsp; That
mind had undergone no change; and she was the self-same woman he
had left her.</p>
<p>He was entranced with joy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>
<p>The fare which the Henrys partook at the cottage of the female
Rymers was such as the sister had described&mdash;mean, and even
scanty; but this did not in the least diminish the happiness they
received in meeting, for the first time since their arrival in
England, human beings who were glad to see them.</p>
<p>At a stinted repast of milk and vegetables, by the glimmering
light of a little brushwood on the hearth, they yet could feel
themselves comparatively blest, while they listened to the
recital of afflictions which had befallen persons around that
very neighbourhood, for whom every delicious viand had been
procured to gratify the taste, every art devised to delight the
other senses.</p>
<p>It was by the side of this glimmering fire that Rebecca and
her sisters told the story of poor Agnes&rsquo;s fate, and of the
thorn it had for ever planted in William&rsquo;s bosom&mdash;of
his reported sleepless, perturbed nights; and his gloomy, or
half-distracted days; when in the fullness of <i>remorse</i>, he
has complained&mdash;&ldquo;of a guilty conscience! of the
weariness attached to a continued prosperity! the misery of
wanting an object of affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They told of Lord Bendham&rsquo;s death from the effects of
intemperance; from a mass of blood infected by high-seasoned
dishes, mixed with copious draughts of wine&mdash;repletion of
food and liquor, not less fatal to the existence of the rich than
the want of common sustenance to the lives of the poor.</p>
<p>They told of Lady Bendham&rsquo;s ruin, since her lord&rsquo;s
death, by gaming.&nbsp; They told, &ldquo;that now she suffered
beyond the pain of common indigence by the cutting triumph of
those whom she had formerly despised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They related (what has been told before) the divorce of
William, and the marriage of his wife with a libertine; the
decease of Lady Clementina, occasioned by that incorrigible
vanity which even old age could not subdue.</p>
<p>After numerous other examples had been recited of the dangers,
the evils that riches draw upon their owner; the elder Henry rose
from his chair, and embracing Rebecca and his son,
said&mdash;&ldquo;How much indebted are we to Providence, my
children, who, while it inflicts poverty, bestows peace of mind;
and in return for the trivial grief we meet in this world, holds
out to our longing hopes the reward of the next!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only resigned, but happy in their station, with hearts
made cheerful rather than dejected by attentive meditation, Henry
and his son planned the means of their future support,
independent of their kinsman William&mdash;nor only of him, but
of every person and thing but their own industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I have health and strength,&rdquo; cried the old
man, and his son&rsquo;s looks acquiesced in all the father said,
&ldquo;I will not take from any one in affluence what only
belongs to the widow, the fatherless, and the infirm; for to such
alone, by Christian laws&mdash;however custom may subvert
them&mdash;the overplus of the rich is due.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>
<p>By forming a humble scheme for their remaining life, a scheme
depending upon their <i>own</i> exertions alone, on no light
promises of pretended friends, and on no sanguine hopes of
certain success, but with prudent apprehension, with fortitude
against disappointment, Henry, his son, and Rebecca (now his
daughter), found themselves, at the end of one year, in the
enjoyment of every comfort with such distinguished minds knew how
to taste.</p>
<p>Exempt both from patronage and from
control&mdash;healthy&mdash;alive to every fruition with which
Nature blesses the world; dead to all out of their power to
attain, the works of art&mdash;susceptible of those passions with
endear human creatures one to another, insensible to those which
separate man from man&mdash;they found themselves the thankful
inhabitants of a small house, or hut, placed on the borders of
the sea.</p>
<p>Each morning wakes the father and the son to cheerful labour
in fishing, or the tending of a garden, the produce of which they
carry to the next market town.&nbsp; The evening sends them back
to their home in joy: where Rebecca meets them at the door,
affectionately boasts of the warm meal that is ready, and
heightens the charm of conversation with her taste and
judgment.</p>
<p>It was after a supper of roots from their garden, poultry that
Rebecca&rsquo;s hand had reared, and a jug brewed by young Henry,
that the following discourse took place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the elder Henry, &ldquo;where under
Heaven shall three persons be met together happy as we three
are?&nbsp; It is the want of industry, or the want of reflection,
which makes the poor dissatisfied.&nbsp; Labour gives a value to
rest which the idle can never taste; and reflection gives to the
mind a degree of content which the unthinking never can
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once,&rdquo; replied the younger Henry,
&ldquo;considered poverty a curse; but after my thoughts became
enlarged, and I had associated for years with the rich, and now
mix with the poor, my opinion has undergone a total change; for I
have seen, and have enjoyed, more real pleasure at work with my
fellow-labourers, and in this cottage, than ever I beheld, or
experienced, during my abode at my uncle&rsquo;s; during all my
intercourse with the fashionable and the powerful of this
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst is,&rdquo; said Rebecca, &ldquo;the poor have
not always enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has enough?&rdquo; asked her husband.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Had my uncle?&nbsp; No: he hoped for more; and in all his
writings sacrificed his duty to his avarice.&nbsp; Had his son
enough, when he yielded up his honour, his domestic peace, to
gratify his ambition?&nbsp; Had Lady Bendham enough, when she
staked all she had, in the hope of becoming richer?&nbsp; Were
we, my Rebecca, of discontented minds, we have now too
little.&nbsp; But conscious, from observation and experience,
that the rich are not so happy as ourselves, we rejoice in our
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tear of joy which stole from her eye expressed, more than
his words, a state of happiness.</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;I remember, when I first came a boy to
England, the poor excited my compassion; but now that my judgment
is matured, I pity the rich.&nbsp; I know that in this opulent
kingdom there are nearly as many persons perishing through
intemperance as starving with hunger; there are as many miserable
in the lassitude of having nothing to do as there are of those
bowed down to the earth with hard labour; there are more persons
who draw upon themselves calamity by following their own will
than there are who experience it by obeying the will of
another.&nbsp; Add to this, that the rich are so much afraid of
dying they have no comfort in living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There the poor have another advantage,&rdquo; said
Rebecca; &ldquo;for they may defy not only death, but every loss
by sea or land, as they have nothing to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added the elder Henry, &ldquo;there is
a certain joy of the most gratifying kind that the human mind is
capable of tasting, peculiar to the poor, and of which the rich
can but seldom experience the delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can that be?&rdquo; cried Rebecca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A kind word, a benevolent smile, one token of esteem
from the person whom we consider as our superior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Rebecca replied, &ldquo;And the rarity of obtaining
such a token is what increases the honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; returned young Henry, &ldquo;and yet
those in poverty, ungrateful as they are, murmur against that
Government from which they receive the blessing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is the fault of education, of early
prejudice,&rdquo; said the elder Henry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our children
observe us pay respect, even reverence, to the wealthy, while we
slight or despise the poor.&nbsp; The impression thus made on
their minds in youth is indelible during the more advanced
periods of life; and they continue to pine after riches, and
lament under poverty: nor is the seeming folly wholly destitute
of reason; for human beings are not yet so deeply sunk in
voluptuous gratification, or childish vanity, as to place delight
in any attainment which has not for its end the love or
admiration of their fellow-beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the poor, then,&rdquo; cried the younger Henry,
&ldquo;no more be their own persecutors&mdash;no longer pay
homage to wealth&mdash;instantaneously the whole idolatrous
worship will cease&mdash;the idol will be broken!&rdquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
